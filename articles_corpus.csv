1,"The Washington State Department of Ecology this week awarded $165.3 million in low-interest loans to help fund two King County water quality projects. The Department of Ecologys Clean Water State Revolving Fund loans will help pay for a water quality project along the Lake Washington Ship Canal and the new Georgetown Wet Weather Treatment Station, according to the county. Both will reduce stormwater pollution, King County Natural Resources and Parks said in an online statement. Polluted stormwater, or runoff that occurs during heavy rainfall, is considered one of the biggest threats to water quality in King County it carries toxics such as motor oil, metals, pesticides, fertilizer and pet waste directly into streams, rivers and Puget Sound, the county said. In partnership with Seattle Public Utilities, the Ship Canal Water Quality Project will prevent an average of 75 million gallons of polluted stormwater and wastewater from flowing into the Lake Washington Ship Canal, Salmon Bay and Lake Union each year, according to the county. The Georgetown Wet Weather Treatment Station, which King County began operating in late 2022, treats up to 70 million gallons of combined stormwater and wastewater per day during heavy storms to help protect the Duwamish River and Puget Sound, according to King County Natural Resources and Parks. The loans will also help the King County Wastewater Treatment Division get the most mileage we can out of these projects while lowering the burden on ratepayers, said Kamuron Gurol, the Wastewater Treatment Division director. The division provides wastewater treatment services to nearly 2 million residents across King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, including the Muckleshoot Tribe. The county said the low-interest loans will save ratepayers $83.5 million in interest costs. Both projects advance plans to prepare the region for climate impacts and reduce and control sewer outflows, and these investments are critical to a clean and healthy Puget Sound now and in the future, Gurol said. In its statement about these loans, the county highlighted other efforts to enhance the regions wastewater system, including a decade of improvements to replace pumps and pipes, make seismic upgrades and provide crews with a more reliable power supply at the West Point Treatment Plant. In addition to protecting public health, restoring and protecting water quality in King County will also combat the dramatic decline in native salmon, which threatens the survival of southern resident orcas, King County Natural Resources and Parks said.

3,"Two more orcas are ailing and probably will be dead by summer, according to the region's expert on the demographics of the critically endangered southern residents.  Ken Balcomb, founding director of the Center for Whale Research, said photos taken of J17 on New Year's Eve showed the 42-year-old female has so-called peanut head, a misshapen head and neck caused by starvation. In addition, K25, a 27-year-old male, is also failing from lack of sufficient food. He lost his mother, K13, in 2017 and is not successfully foraging on his own.  ""I am confident we are going to lose them sometime before summer,"" Balcomb said.  Drone photography this past summer showed K25 to be noticeably thinner, and photos taken of him again in this winter show no improvement, Balcomb said.  Several whales were documented to be pregnant in September, but so far there has been no sign of any babies. The southern residents have not had a successful pregnancy in three years.  The troubling news comes on top of a grim year in 2018 for the southern residents, the J, K and L pods of fish-eating orcas that frequent the Salish Sea, which includes Puget Sound and the transboundary waters of the United States and Canada, as well as the West Coast of the United States.  The southern resident population is at a 35-year low after three deaths this past year in four months. There are only 74 left.  ""I am going to stop counting at 70,"" Balcomb said. ""What is the point?""  Losing J17 would be a blow to the southern residents because she is a female still of reproducing age, said Deborah Giles, research scientist for University of Washington Center for Conservation Biology and research director for nonprofit Wild Orca.  Giles said she was not surprised to hear about K25. The social dynamics of the southern residents, in which older females help their pod, and especially their sons by sharing food, is both a blessing and a curse if that female dies, Giles said.  ""These large, adult, hungry males benefit by the females in their family,"" Giles said. ""There probably is still family foraging going on, but not like he had when his mom was alive.""  As for J17, ""that is the worst of those two, the thought of losing her, she is such an important member for the southern resident community,"" Giles said.  J17 is the mother of J35, or Tahlequah, who moved people around the world when in 2018 she carried her dead calf that lived for only one half-hour on her head for more than 1,000 miles over the course of 17 days.  The family already has been through a lot.  ""We have no idea what that grandmother went through, watching her daughter carry around that baby as long as she did,"" Giles said. ""What would that have been like. To watch your daughter go through that grief and not have much you can do about it.""  The same family in 2016 also lost J54, a 1-year-old whale the whole family tried to support, especially his sister, J46, feeding him, and lifting the baby whale up with their teeth every time he started to sink. ""The other whales were trying to support him,"" Balcomb said. ""He had tooth rakes all over his body, but it wasn't malicious. He was sinking.""  It is hard to confront a new year with two whales already failing, Giles said. ""It is this anticipatory grief. I am worried. And I am afraid.""  Drone photography taken in September showed the southern residents went into the winter thinner than they were when the whales arrived in the San Juan Islands last summer. They also are thinner than the northern residents, which have been steadily growing in population for the past 40 years in their home waters primarily in northern B.C. and southeast Alaska, where they have access to more fish and cleaner and quieter water. The northern residents gave birth to 10 new calves last year.  The southern residents look particularly thin next to the seal-eating transient, or Bigg's, killer whales.  ""They are like marshmallows,"" Balcomb said.  The coming year is not looking any easier for the southern residents in terms of their food supply. The whales mostly eat chinook salmon.  Ocean conditions and poor river migration, with warm water and low flows, have hurt chinook salmon returns in the past several years. Even Columbia River fall chinook, a bright spot by comparison in the region, came back to the river in such low numbers last summer that a rare emergency fishing closure was enacted on the river from the mouth all the way to Pasco.  Only 186,862 fall chinook made it back below Bonneville dam in 2018, 65 percent below the 10-year average. Returns over Bonneville of jacks, or immature chinook, which can be a reliable predictor of this year's return, were down to 61 percent below the 10-year average.  Columbia River chinook are important to the whales because they are among the biggest, fattiest fish of all. The whales also target chinook returning to rivers in Puget Sound and, in the summer, to the Fraser River. Those runs have been declining as well.  The whales' behavior is changing as their food sources dwindle. They are arriving later in the San Juan Islands because the Fraser River chinook runs they seek in those waters have so declined. The southern residents also are no longer often seen in large groups, in a pattern of feeding, then socializing, then resting before going on to a new spot.  ""They do not have enough fish to feed them. They are spread out all over. We never see them like it was 30, 40 years ago when they would travel and find fish, then be playful, then rest, then travel again, that was the pattern,"" Balcomb said.  ""You don't see them resting any more. They have to work all the time, every day.""  He said proposals put forward for the whales in the governor's $1.1 billion budget for orca recovery, including a temporary ban on whale watching of the southern residents, don't go far enough.  ""We need bold action,"" Balcomb said. ""Natural rivers and more chinook salmon.""

4,"SEATTLE (AP) - Two more Puget Sound orcas are ailing and probably will be dead by summer, according an expert on the critically endangered population of killer whales that live in the waters of the Pacific Northwest. Drone photography taken this past September showed the ailing population of orcas known as the southern residents went into the winter thinner than they were when the whales arrived in the San Juan Islands last summer. They also are thinner than Puget Sound's so-called northern resident population of killer whales, which have been steadily growing in population for the past 40 years in their home waters primarily in northern British Columbia and southeast Alaska, where they have access to more fish and cleaner and quieter water. The northern residents gave birth to 10 new calves last year. The Seattle Times reports Center for Whale Research founding director Ken Balcomb said photos taken of a southern resident orca known as J17 on New Year's Eve showed the 42-year-old female has so-called peanut head - a misshapen head and neck caused by starvation.

5,"Advocates planning to reintroduce Lolita to Puget Sound MIAMI - More than 50 years after the orca known as Lolita was captured for public display, plans are in place to return her from the Miami Seaquarium to her home waters in the Pacific Northwest, where a nearly century-old, endangered killer whale believed to be her mother still swims. An unlikely coalition involving the theme park's owner, an animal rights group and an NFL owner-philanthropist announced the agreement during a news conference Thursday. ""I'm excited to be a part of Lolita's journey to freedom,"" Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said. ""I know Lolita wants to get to free waters."" Lolita, also known as Tokitae, was about 4 years old when she was captured in Puget Sound in summer 1970, during a time of deadly orca roundups. She spent decades performing for paying crowds before falling ill. Last year the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer stage shows with her, under an agreement with federal regulators. Lolita - now 57 years old and 5,000 pounds - currently lives in a tank that measures 80 feet by 35 feet and is 20 feet deep. The orca believed to be her mother, called Ocean Sun, continues to swim free with other members of their clan - known as L pod - and is estimated to be more than 90 years old. That has given advocates of her release optimism that Tokitae could still maybe have a long life in the wild. ""It's a step toward restoring our natural environment, fixing what we've messed up with exploitation and development,"" said Howard Garrett, president of the board of the advocacy group Orca Network, based on Whidbey Island. ""I think she'll be excited and relieved to be home - it's her old neighborhood."" The agreement among Irsay; Eduardo Albor, who heads The Dolphin Company, which owns the Seaquarium; and the Florida nonprofit Friends of Toki, co-founded by environmentalist Pritam Singh, still faces hurdles to gaining government approval. The time frame for moving the animal could be 18 to 24 months away, the group said, and the cost could reach $20 million. The plan is to transport Lolita by plane to an ocean sanctuary in the waters between Washington and Canada, where she will initially swim inside a large net while trainers and veterinarians teach her how to catch fish. She will also have to build up her muscles, as orcas typically swim about 100 miles per day, said Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington who also serves on the board of Friends of Toki. ""She was 4 when she was taken, so she was learning to hunt. She knows her family song,"" Morris said. ""She'll remember, but it will take time."" The orca would be under 24-hour care until she acclimates to her new surroundings. Caretakers at the Seaquarium are already preparing her for the journey, officials said. The Dolphin Company took ownership of the Seaquarium in 2021. It operates some 27 other parks and habitats in Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Italy. The legacy of the whale roundups of the 1960s and '70s continues to haunt a distinct group of endangered, salmon-eating orcas that are known as the southern resident killer whales and spend much of their time in the waters between Washington and Canada. At least 13 orcas died in the roundups and 45 were delivered to theme parks around the world, reducing the Puget Sound resident population by about 40 percent and helping cause problems with inbreeding that remain an issue today. Today only 73 remain in the southern resident population, which comprises three familial groups called pods, according to the Center for Whale Research on Washington's San Juan Island. That's just two more animals than in 1971. Animal rights advocates including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have long fought for Tokitae to spend her final years back home in a controlled setting. Activists often protest along the road that runs by the Seaquarium, which they've referred to as an ""abusement park."" PETA says it doesn't want Lolita to suffer the same fate as her partner Hugo, who died in 1980 from a brain aneurysm after ramming his head repeatedly into the tank's walls. Albor said Thursday that back when his company was acquiring the Seaquarium, he and his daughter visited as tourists. He said his daughter became upset while watching Lolita's show, even as many other in the crowd were squealing in delight. His daughter told him ""this place is too small for Lolita"" and made him promise to help the orca if his company bought the park. ""It has always been our commitment at The Dolphin Company that we place the highest priority on the well-being of the animals above all else,"" Albor said. ""Finding a better future for Lolita is one of the reasons that motivated us to acquire the Miami Seaquarium."" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava called the relocation plan historic, saying, ""So many have hoped and prayed for this result for many, many years."" The Seaquarium opened in 1955 on Virginia Key east of downtown Miami.

6,"Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson issued the following news release: * * * - Navy ignored concerns raised by EPA, Washington Department of Ecology * * * In a letter to the federal government, Attorney General Bob Ferguson today announced his intent to join a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Navy's process to scrape the hulls of decommissioned vessels, which leads to ongoing pollution of Sinclair Inlet and harms salmon and orcas. To clean a 60,000-ton, decommissioned aircraft carrier before transport, the Navy scraped the hull of the ship in Puget Sound in January 2017. The process released approximately 50 dump truck loads of solid materials, including copper and zinc, into the sound. Copper and zinc are highly toxic to marine life. A study conducted by the Navy found that the level of pollutants it released far exceed standards allowed by Washington state. The initial release of these metals, and their continued discharge of pollutants into the inlet, violate state and federal laws. In June 2017, Puget Soundkeeper Alliance, the Washington Environmental Council and the Suquamish Tribe filed a lawsuit against the Navy, asserting that the military branch violated the federal Clean Water Act by releasing toxic substances into the inlet without a permit while cleaning the hull of a decommissioned aircraft carrier. In the letter, Ferguson asserts that the release of the pollutants violated both federal and state Clean Water Acts, as well as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Attorney General advises the federal government that he will seek to join the groups' case if the Navy does not resolve the issue within 60 days. Ferguson and the groups ask the court to require the Navy to clean up its recent discharge of toxic materials and prevent it from releasing more into Puget Sound in the future. ""Keeping Puget Sound clean is vital to the health of Washingtonians and our struggling salmon and orcas,"" said Ferguson. ""The Navy must follow the same rules as everyone else to protect our waters."" The Navy's Puget Sound Naval Shipyard near Bremerton provides dock space for decommissioned, non-operational military vessels. These ships await dismantling, recycling and disposal. To complete this process, the Navy transports the vessels to other facilities around the U.S. In 2016, the Navy decided to transport the ex-USS Independence, a decommissioned aircraft carrier, to Texas for dismantling. Before moving the decommissioned ship, the Navy consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) -- as required by law -- to ensure that the move would not pose any dangers to threatened or endangered species. NMFS recommended that the Navy clean the hull to avoid spreading potential invasive species. NMFS also provided suggestions on how to do so while minimizing discharges of potentially toxic waste into Sinclair Inlet. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington State Department of Ecology raised concerns after the Navy announced its plan to clean the ex-Independence, which would release several pollutants into Puget Sound. Despite these concerns, the Navy proceeded to clean the hull of the ship in the waters of Sinclair Inlet in early 2017. The cleaning and scraping of the hull released several pollutants, including copper and zinc, into the waters and sediment of Sinclair Inlet. Copper and zinc are highly toxic to marine life and affect the health of the entire aquatic food chain, including salmon and orcas. For example, copper can harm salmon's ability to navigate to spawning streams or to avoid predators. Since the Navy has not attempted to contain the release of various pollutants, such as paint chips, they continue to release copper, zinc and other toxic metals into Puget Sound. Another decommissioned aircraft carrier, the ex-USS Kitty Hawk, currently awaits transport to the scrapping site in Texas. Ferguson, along with the groups that originally brought the case, fear the Navy will clean the vessel in the same way as the ex-Independence, further releasing toxic materials into the water. With the lawsuit, the parties seek to stop the Navy from contaminating the site in the future. In the letter, Ferguson writes: ""We ask that the Navy remedy its ongoing violations of the [Clean Water Act] and Washington law, and abate the imminent and substantial endangerment under RCRA, at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard by removing from Sinclair Inlet the debris from the ex-Independence and taking any other action necessary to stop and remediate the ongoing discharge of pollutants and related environmental harm caused by the Navy's in-water hull cleaning activities."" The Navy's longstanding activities at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard have resulted in significant amounts of hazardous waste being released into Sinclair Inlet for more than a century. Due to the heavy contamination, the EPA considers Sinclair Inlet a Superfund site, and the federal government has spent millions attempting to clean its waters. The inlet currently does not meet standards for human recreation, fish consumption or the protection of aquatic life. Assistant Attorney General Kelly Wood and Special Assistant Attorney General Aurora Janke with the Counsel for Environmental Protection are handling this case on behalf of the Attorney General's Office. Protecting the environment is one of Ferguson's top priorities. In 2016, he created the Counsel for Environmental Protection to protect our environment and the safety and health of all Washingtonians.

7,"For Love of Orcas: An Anthology Edited by Andrew Shattuck McBride and Jill McCabe Johnson. Wandering Aengus Press, 2019. 178 pages. $20. Last year, when an orca (killer whale) known as Tahlequah and a thousand miles around Puget Sound and nearby waters, the public and media worldwide were riveted by the spectacle. The event brought renewed and fervent attention to the endangered orcas known as the Southern Residents; these fish-eating whales have been in trouble for years, principally due to the decline in the region's chinook salmon but affected as well by noise, disturbance, ship strikes, and pollution. ""For Love of Orcas"" grew from the story of Tahlequah and her calf, as a way for poets and writers to bring even more attention to the plight of the whales and to larger issues about caring for our planet and its creatures. Co-editor Jill McCabe Johnson writes in her introduction, ""This book is not a how-to for saving the planet. Instead, it's a reminder of the complex and exquisite beauty surrounding us. Our hope is that readers will care enough to coalesce and bring our interactions with and effects on that beauty back into balance."" As with any anthology, the selections here are varied and uneven. Ninety-two poets and writers, mostly from the Northwest, are included, some more than once. A few contributors are scientists as well as writers. A few are activists. Poetry greatly outnumbers the short prose pieces. Alaskans are represented by the late Eva Saulitis, former poets laureate Peggy Shumaker and Ernestine Hayes, and Fairbanksan Daryl Farmer. There is and has always been debate about whether art can also be political. The famed writer Toni Morrison spoke emphatically about this: ""The best art is political and you ought to be able to make it unquestionably political and irrevocably beautiful at the same time."" Not everything in this volume is great or even mediocre art, but it is all heart-felt, genuine expressions of human concern for the world in which we live. Likely because the impetus for the book was the one whale and her dead calf, references to Tahlequah (also known as J35) abound, with the same details repeated again and again. The rawness of the event surely influenced emotions and the urge of so many to respond in words of grief, guilt, loss, and outrage. If there's a surfeit of earnestness here, maybe that's what's necessary to drive change. More complex and language-rich selections are presented by writers with deeper connections to orcas than simply having watched them from a boat or shore (the most common experience shared here.) These also invite readers into questioning and conversation, as opposed to instructing and admonishing. They include two pieces from the scientist-poet Eva Saulitis, who spent decades studying the orcas of Alaska's Prince William Sound. Both are excerpts from her book ""Leaving Resurrection: Chronicles of a Whale Scientist."" One of these, ""Halfway Down an Alder Slope,"" perfectly captures the joy of careening down a hillside to nearly leap into the water among orcas; it ends with a naming: ""The killer whales are called aaxlu, tukxukuak, agliuk, mesungesak, polossatik, skana, keet, feared one, grampus, blackfish, orca, big-fin, fat-chopper. Whale killer. From the realm of the dead. Orcinus orca."" The second Saulitis excerpt, ""In the Tlingit Language,"" discusses the dilemma of scientists who love what they study but, also, need to be intrusive in some of their research. ""And the more we know, the longer we stay, the more we care, and caring, like anthropomorphism, is tricky ground for that detached creature, the scientist."" Another prose piece, ""Dio,"" by biologist and writer Paula MacKay, brings fascinating new information into the orca discussion. MacKay accompanies researchers training dogs to detect orca scat so that it can be collected from the water and analyzed not just for diet but for other health indicators. We learn from this that analyses of hormones collected from hundreds of Southern Resident orcas indicate a 69% pregnancy failure rate. Other work here might be appreciated for other types of witnessing and for finding beauty in our troubled world. Several poems don't mention orcas at all but celebrate salmon or the natural world that contains salmon, orcas, and humans. Others angle in at our connections and responsibilities from sidelong directions or arrest us with startling imagery. For example, the poem ""Landscape with No Net Loss"" by Jenifer Browne Lawrence speaks with the voice of someone working at a river's mouth with survey tools and cables. ""Longfin smelt change direction midair, belly-slap/to avoid the Chinook or shake loose eggs/or just for the hell of it, who knows, we are all/bouncing off one body and into another."" Another poem, ""Interlude,"" by Tina Schumann, merely suggests the two whales with its imagery of ""spark and falter,"" ""ignition and idle engine,"" comparisons of music to lapping water and ""this small body and the painting of a body."" The impassioned work in ""For Love of Orcas"" makes clear that orcas hold a special place in human lives and imaginations. These animals, identified as individuals by their markings and relationships, elicit concern and compassion, even love, as no mussel or candlefish or any other marine species smaller than a whale ever will. That is something to celebrate. Graphic   See image link Tahlequah pushes her dead calf on the second day of her long, sad journey.

8,"Olympia: Office of the Attornay General, The State of Washington has issued the following news release: In a letter to the federal government, Attorney General Bob Ferguson today announced his intent to join a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Navy’s process to scrape the hulls of decommissioned vessels, which leads to ongoing pollution of Sinclair Inlet and harms salmon and orcas. To clean a 60,000-ton, decommissioned aircraft carrier before transport, the Navy scraped the hull of the ship in Puget Sound in January 2017. The process released approximately 50 dump truck loads of solid materials, including copper and zinc, into the sound. Copper and zinc are highly toxic to marine life. A study conducted by the Navy found that the level of pollutants it released far exceed standards allowed by Washington state.  The initial release of these metals, and their continued discharge of pollutants into the inlet, violate state and federal laws. In June 2017, Puget Soundkeeper Alliance, the Washington Environmental Council and the Suquamish Tribe filed a lawsuit against the Navy, asserting that the military branch violated the federal Clean Water Act by releasing toxic substances into the inlet without a permit while cleaning the hull of a decommissioned aircraft carrier. In the letter, Ferguson asserts that the release of the pollutants violated both federal and state Clean Water Acts, as well as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Attorney General advises the federal government that he will seek to join the groups’ case if the Navy does not resolve the issue within 60 days. Ferguson and the groups ask the court to require the Navy to clean up its recent discharge of toxic materials and prevent it from releasing more into Puget Sound in the future. “Keeping Puget Sound clean is vital to the health of Washingtonians and our struggling salmon and orcas,” said Ferguson. “The Navy must follow the same rules as everyone else to protect our waters.” The Navy’s Puget Sound Naval Shipyard near Bremerton provides dock space for decommissioned, non-operational military vessels. These ships await dismantling, recycling and disposal. To complete this process, the Navy transports the vessels to other facilities around the U.S. In 2016, the Navy decided to transport the ex-USS Independence, a decommissioned aircraft carrier, to Texas for dismantling. Before moving the decommissioned ship, the Navy consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) — as required by law — to ensure that the move would not pose any dangers to threatened or endangered species. NMFS recommended that the Navy clean the hull to avoid spreading potential invasive species. NMFS also provided suggestions on how to do so while minimizing discharges of potentially toxic waste into Sinclair Inlet. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Washington State Department of Ecology raised concerns after the Navy announced its plan to clean the ex-Independence, which would release several pollutants into Puget Sound. Despite these concerns, the Navy proceeded to clean the hull of the ship in the waters of Sinclair Inlet in early 2017. The cleaning and scraping of the hull released several pollutants, including copper and zinc, into the waters and sediment of Sinclair Inlet. Copper and zinc are highly toxic to marine life and affect the health of the entire aquatic food chain, including salmon and orcas. For example, copper can harm salmon’s ability to navigate to spawning streams or to avoid predators. Since the Navy has not attempted to contain the release of various pollutants, such as paint chips, they continue to release copper, zinc and other toxic metals into Puget Sound. Another decommissioned aircraft carrier, the ex-USS Kitty Hawk, currently awaits transport to the scrapping site in Texas. Ferguson, along with the groups that originally brought the case, fear the Navy will clean the vessel in the same way as the ex-Independence, further releasing toxic materials into the water. With the lawsuit, the parties seek to stop the Navy from contaminating the site in the future. In the letter, Ferguson writes: “We ask that the Navy remedy its ongoing violations of the [Clean Water Act] and Washington law, and abate the imminent and substantial endangerment under RCRA, at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard by removing from Sinclair Inlet the debris from the ex-Independence and taking any other action necessary to stop and remediate the ongoing discharge of pollutants and related environmental harm caused by the Navy's in-water hull cleaning activities.” The Navy’s longstanding activities at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard have resulted in significant amounts of hazardous waste being released into Sinclair Inlet for more than a century. Due to the heavy contamination, the EPA considers Sinclair Inlet a Superfund site, and the federal government has spent millions attempting to clean its waters. The inlet currently does not meet standards for human recreation, fish consumption or the protection of aquatic life. Assistant Attorney General Kelly Wood and Special Assistant Attorney General Aurora Janke with the Counsel for Environmental Protection are handling this case on behalf of the Attorney General’s Office. Protecting the environment is one of Ferguson’s top priorities. In 2016, he created the Counsel for Environmental Protection to protect our environment and the safety and health of all Washingtonians.

9,"The following information was released by Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan: U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski (both R-Alaska), and Representative Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska), filed an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington this week supporting Southeast Alaska troll fishermen in a case that threatens to shut down their small boat troll fishery on the pretense that their salmon harvest is a primary contributor to the population decline of Southern resident killer whales hundreds of miles away in Puget Sound. The lawsuit does not consider the potential impacts of similar fisheries in Oregon and Washington. On December 13, 2022, a Seattle-based magistrate judge ruled largely in favor of the Wild Fish Conservancy, an extreme environmental group challenging the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the case. If the District Court upholds the magistrate judge's ruling, the decision could shut down the Southeast Alaska fishery and upset the careful balance struck between conservation, harvest sharing and promoting sustainable fisheries. A shutdown would be detrimental to Southeast coastal communities and hard-working Alaska fishermen. In their amicus brief, the congressional delegation notes that Congress allocated millions of dollars in recent years for a hatchery-based ""prey increase program"" supporting Chinook salmon numbers to provide additional food sources for Puget Sound orcas and to offset any minimal impact caused by the Southeast troll fishery. Mitigation measures like the prey increase program are evaluated and accounted for when harvest limits are adopted by the binational Pacific Salmon Commission. ""Our state's small boat, hook-and-line troll salmon fishermenthe ultimate small business ownersare under assault by a Lower 48 environmental group, known for its extreme positions, claiming our fishery is endangering the continued existence of Puget Sound orcas hundreds of miles away,"" said Senator Sullivan . ""What's most remarkable about this case is that the magistrate judge and the Wild Fish Conservancy totally ignore much more likely causes of the orca decline, like the toxins, pollution, noise disturbance, and vessel traffic that have undoubtedly wreaked havoc in the Puget Sound region. In Alaska, we are no strangers to extreme environmental groups filing meritless, deceptive lawsuits with no regard for how these lawsuits hurt our fellow Alaskans. Over the last several weeks, I've met with fishing industry leaders, the NOAA administrator, and the NMFS administrator to encourage them to vigorously defend our fishermen and this fishery against this lawsuit in court for as long as it takes, and to ensure our fishermen have a season and are not tied up at the dock while we work through this. Both the NOAA and NMFS administrators have assured me that they will. We will fight this frivolous, shameful lawsuit with everything in our power, and work to ensure Alaska's sustainable fisheries are supported with science-based management. I also want to thank so many other Alaska stakeholdersthe State, our Legislature, and several Southeast communitieswho are also very focused on fighting this lawsuit."" ""Fishing is fundamental to Alaskans. And to have our Southeast troll fisheries at risk of being shut down because of litigation from a Washington-based environmental organization is flat out wrong. While we work to understand the effects of changing climate on our oceans and fisheries, we must work together to ensure those most impacted have the tools and ability to adapt. Shutting down small-boat fisheries that are vital to Alaska's coastal communities is not the answer. Our Southeast Alaska fisheriesmany of which are family-run operationsare understandably panicked by these potential closures and the cascading impacts they could have on the region,"" said Senator Murkowski . ""Our Alaska delegation is united in defending our fishermen and our coastal communities from outsiders who threaten our Alaskan way of life."" ""This lawsuit is misguided and unhelpful for the salmon and whales,"" said Representative Peltola . ""The proposed 'solution' of shutting down a critical fishery is among the least effective and most painful ways to address the killer whale population challenges. It completely ignores the most likely causes of the whales' population struggles, which include pollution, ship traffic, and habitat degradation. It would do significant damage to small-boat fishing families who rely on this fishery to make a living, while also negatively impacting the Pacific Salmon Treaty and tribal fishing rights. I'm as critical as anyone about the shortcomings of our fisheries management, but this lawsuit doesn't contribute to the science or management efforts at allinstead, it just threatens a single user group with economic ruin. I will continue to work with scientists, managers, stakeholders and local leaders to find ways forward that protect this crucial resource and keep fishermen fishing whenever we can."" The State of Alaska and the Alaska Trollers Association are interveners in the lawsuit. On March 2, the Alaska House of Representatives passed a resolution urging state and federal agencies to defend the Southeast troll fishermen in court. The Alaska fishermen have also received resolutions of support from the City of Wrangell, the City of Sitka, and the Ketchikan Gateway Borough, among others. # # # Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: DECISIONS & RULINGS (90%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (90%); FISHES (90%); FISHING WORKERS (90%); JUDGES (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); LITIGATION (90%); MARINE MAMMALS (90%); SUITS & CLAIMS (90%); US CONGRESS (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); FINFISH FISHING (89%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (89%); NEGATIVE NEWS (89%); POPULATION DECLINE (89%); SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES (89%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (88%); SUSTAINABILITY (88%); NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS (77%); CONSERVATION (76%); FISHING LAW (76%); POLLUTION (74%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (74%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); SMALL BUSINESS (71%); COASTAL AREAS (67%) Industry: FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (90%); FISHING WORKERS (90%); FINFISH FISHING (89%); SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES (89%); FISHING, HUNTING & TRAPPING (77%); AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING & HUNTING (76%); FISHING LAW (76%) Person: DANIEL SULLIVAN (92%); MARY PELTOLA (79%); LISA MURKOWSKI (58%) Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (92%); ALASKA, USA (96%); WASHINGTON, USA (95%); OREGON, USA (79%); UNITED STATES (94%)"
10,"It’s heartening to see that Lolita the killer whale will soon be returning to Puget Sound and freedom after spending more than 50 years in captivity. Lolita, a.k.a. Toki, who was a member of the L Pod of southern resident orcas that spend most of their time in the waters off Washington and British Columbia, was captured in 1970 when she was just about four years old, at a time when it was acceptable to take these highly intelligent and sociable beings away from their families, stick them in small swimming pools and force them to perform demeaning tricks for people’s entertainment. Fortunately, this practice has come under intense scrutiny and criticism in recent years as humans have slowly come to realize just how cruel it is to these most remarkable creatures, and the aquariums that host orcas around the world have come to their senses (added to the fact that they must be seeing income from people who come to view these performances plummet) with many coming up with plans to have them released back into the wild. Friends of Lolita, a not-forprofit organization, and the Miami Seaquarium where Lolita has lived since 1970 in an 80-by-35-foot concrete tank, have announced they plan to return Lolita to the area in Puget Sound where she was captured within the next 18 to 24 months. But Lolita will face many challenges when she returns to her home. It’s been more than 50 years since she last saw her pod and family, and she might not remember them (nor they her) if and when they meet each other again. If that happens and she doesn’t reconnect with her family, her freedom may be short lived as it’s possible she won’t remember the skills to hunt and survive in the open ocean and won’t survive long, despite the best efforts of the release team to teach her before letting her loose. But, apparently, it’s believed that her mother is still alive (orcas can live up to 90 years in the wild) so I would find it hard to believe that such intelligent mammals would forget their own children, no matter how long they’ve been away. As well, it’s encouraging that Lolita got pretty excited when recorded sounds made by her pod communicating with each other were played for her in her tank at Miami Seaquarium, so it appears she recognizes their voices after all this time. Regardless, no matter how well she does in the wild when she’s finally released, I think it’s just something that has to be done. Such animals should never live in captivity, and that was made very apparent with the story of Tilikum, the orca that killed three of his trainers over his lifetime. He killed them in separate incidents, including one in Victoria’s Sealand of the Pacific, before he tragically died of natural causes in 2017 in a Florida aquarium, miles from his home in the deep blue sea near Greenland where he was captured in 1983. I’ve no doubt Tilikum remembered where he came from and built up a deep resentment for these two-legged beings that forced him to do stupid tricks and, in between these performances, kept him locked up in tiny pools where he could barely move around. Tilikum lived a sad and cruel life and he apparently decided to return the favour to three of his handlers when the opportunities arose. But, in my experience coming across orcas in the wild, they are intelligent, curious and perfectly in tune with their environment, and to have one such as Tilikum become a human killer was an aberration caused by man and captivity. In fact, there is not one documented case of an orca living in the wild killing a person. We live in a part of the world where we’re lucky to see these majestic animals in their natural environment right on our doorsteps. Despite their intimidating name, I can say I’ve never felt frightened or intimated by them in any way when I used to kayak much more than I do these days, and they would sometimes get pretty close to my boat as they curiously checked me out before moving on.

13,"(TNStalk) -- The Animal Legal Defense Fund issued the following agency statement on March 30, 2023: * * * Lolita the orca is now more than 50 years old following her capture from Puget Sound in 1970 and has been held captive at the Miami Seaquarium ever since. To make matters even worse, Lolita has been deprived of the company of any orcas since 1980, when her last companion, Hugo, rammed his own head against the tank's wall until he died. The terrible cruelty of holding orcas in captivity is clear from research and advocacy over the years showing behavioral markers of extreme stress, physical injury, violence, and lifespans decades shorter than those of wild orcas. Taking what we know about orcas and Lolita's personal experience, not only should she be the last orca to be held captive at the Seaquarium -- no orcas should be held in captivity. A tank will never match the vastness of the ocean where orcas should be free to live out their lives. While we defer to orca experts on whether this move is a safe decision for Lolita, we will continue to advocate for orca protections that ban their captivity and captive breeding and litigate to uphold the Animal Welfare Act on behalf of captive animals. * * * Original text here: https://aldf.org/article/statement-on-lolita/ [Category: Law/Legal] Copyright Targeted News Services null-8116691 MSTRUCK Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: ANIMAL RIGHTS (90%); MARINE MAMMALS (90%); ANIMAL WELFARE (78%); ANIMALS (78%); LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (74%); DEATH & DYING (71%); WOUNDS & INJURIES (70%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (69%) Geographic: MIAMI, FL, USA (72%); CALIFORNIA, USA (73%)"
14,"The social and economic fabric of Puget Sound depends on development, but it cannot come at the expense of the endangered species that make their home in the region. Recent efforts by the National Marine Fisheries Service seek to strike a crucial balance. It is an important step in helping salmon recovery that supports tribal and commercial fisheries, as well as safeguarding the orcas which depend on salmon for food. The National Marine Fisheries Service, also known as NOAA Fisheries, has updated how it evaluates projects that impact nearshore habitat, which includes tidal marshes, wetlands and river estuaries. Structures such as marinas, docks, piers, bulkheads and sea walls have destroyed much of the space where salmon grow before heading out to the ocean. Young Puget Sound chinook salmon spend their first critical months in saltwater, feeding and growing in the sheltered water of nearshore habitat, officials said. That growth time is essential in determining whether the salmon can make it back to rivers as adults to spawn. More than 70 percent of nearshore habitat in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea is gone. ""The challenge before us was how we would be able, under the Endangered Species Act, to protect and conserve those species as well as providing sustainable development,"" said Kim Kratz, assistant regional administrator for NOAA Fisheries' West Coast region. The answer was to set a baseline of no net loss of existing habitat. When projects seek permitting through the Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA Fisheries is consulted for impact to threatened and endangered species. Developers must either reduce a project's impact or offset it, which is a new bar to meet in Puget Sound, officials said. ""Developers have a lot of options,"" said NOAA Fisheries spokesman Michael Milstein. ""They can redesign the project to reduce the impact, they can fund restoration efforts as part of the project, like taking out creosote pilings that are toxic, or they can obtain credits for restoration elsewhere."" The agency has created what they call a Salish Sea Nearshore Programmatic, which guides developers on how they can meet requirements and allows for predictability and faster approval. It also has developed a ""conservation calculator,"" which uses the latest research to determine how many habitat credits would offset a project's impact on wildlife. Having a policy of no net loss, when the existing loss has been so great, seems like a case of too little, too late. However, holding the line on existing habitat provides a solid foundation for recovery efforts to build on. ""No net loss can actually advance recovery, as opposed to some of those recovery programs subsidizing that continuing loss of habitat through development,"" Kratz said. The Puget Sound is a crucial front in the battle to protect salmon and whale populations. These efforts by NOAA Fisheries to recognize the importance of development while keeping wildlife safe are worthy of praise.

15,"For creatures that eat 400 pounds of salmon a day, killer whales are startlingly human. They live as long as you do. They never escape the controlling influence of their moms. They love to show off. Consider J-22, also known as Oreo. She is a 21-year-old killer whale -- or orca -- with serious family obligations. She has three offspring to watch over and rarely ventures far from J-pod, her extended family, which is led by a vigorous 92-year-old matriarch named Granny. On a recent day, Oreo slipped briefly away from Granny and approached a whale-watching boat. As cameras clicked, Oreo launched herself high out of the water, jumping for the sheer, show-offy heck of it. She is about 25 feet long and weighs more than 8,000 pounds, so it was an energy-expensive heave. Resident killer whales in Puget Sound routinely do this sort of thing to the delight of human beings. In return, over recent decades, humans have destroyed about 90 percent of their salmon supply, contaminated the sound with toxic chemicals and, in the 1960s and '70s, kidnapped scores of young killer whales to perform in aquatic shows. Now, federal amends are being made. Southern resident killer whales of Puget Sound -- there are just 89 of them in three pods, all numbered and named, with birth dates and family trees posted on the Internet -- were listed late last year as endangered species. In June, the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed protecting most of Puget Sound as critical habitat for the whales, which are actually the world's largest dolphins. The proposal, encompassing 2,564 square miles at the heart one of the nation's busiest commercial waterways, has alarmed local industry. Building and farm groups have sued to stop the proposal, due to become law by November, arguing that it would require a costly review of future industrial development, home construction, sewer treatment, road construction and water use around the sound, an inland waterway surrounding by nearly 4 million people. Russell Brooks, managing attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is leading the legal challenge, warns that the listing of killer whales as endangered could create unforeseen economic fallout in the Pacific Northwest comparable to what followed the listing of northern spotted owls in the early 1990s. Then, 80 percent of federal forests from Washington to Northern California were closed to logging and an estimated 30,000 timber industry jobs disappeared. The spotted owl, by the way, is still in severe decline, and scientists do not know how to save it. ""This is not really about killer whales at all,"" said Mr. Brooks, whose group specializes in trying to rein in the economic impact of the Endangered Species Act. ""This is a tool used by those who wish to impose their own version of non-land use on Puget Sound."" But for champions of the orcas -- and their numbers are growing, with an estimated 150,000 people paying about $70 each to go out every year in boats to watch and wonder at the whales in Puget Sound -- federal protection has been welcomed as an overdue gift. ""We are very, very happy about this,"" said Ralph Munro, a former Washington secretary of state and a longtime activist who, like many ardent orca admirers, says he's had ""mystical"" encounters with the creatures. ""I know it sounds kooky,"" Mr. Munro, 63, said during a break at a recent public hearing on the plan to make Puget Sound a protected zone, ""but I can show you 10 people in this room who have had mystical experiences with orcas."" (It is a linguistic tic of the debate over these marine mammals that supporters of the endangered species listing tend to call them orcas, while opponents of the listing tend to call them killer whales.) Mr. Munro's special encounter, he said, occurred seven year ago after the death of Ralph. According to several eyewitness accounts, just as Mr. Munro began to deliver a eulogy for his deceased namesake, a large scrum of orcas -- from all three pods based in Puget Sound -- converged in the waters beside the park, where they jumped and frolicked for hours. The emotional appeal of killer whales in the green-leaning Puget Sound region is difficult to overstate. Local news coverage borders on the obsessive. Ralph's 1999 funeral was covered by three local television stations, Mr. Munro said. The accidental death this year of Luna, a 6-year-old orphan orca killed by a tugboat propeller, occasioned widespread news coverage and op-ed hand-wringing.

16,"SEATTLE - People have taken many steps in recent decades to help the Pacific Northwest's endangered killer whales, which have long suffered from starvation, pollution and the legacy of having many of their number captured for display in marine parks. They've breached dikes and removed dams to create wetland habitat for chinook salmon, the orcas' most important food. They've limited commercial fishing to try to ensure prey for the whales. They've made boats slow down and keep farther away from the animals to reduce their stress and to quiet the waters so they can better hunt. So far, those efforts have had limited success, and research published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution suggests why: The whales are so inbred that they are dying younger and their population is not recovering. Female killer whales take about 20 years to reach peak fertility, and the females may not be living long enough to ensure the growth of their population. While that news sounds grim for the revered orcas - known as the ""southern resident"" killer whales - it also underscores the urgency of conservation efforts, said Kim Parsons, a geneticist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's NOAA Fisheries who co-authored the study. The population is not necessarily doomed, she said. ""It's not often inbreeding itself that will result in a shortened lifespan or kill an individual,"" Parsons said. ""It's really that inbreeding makes these individuals more vulnerable to disease or environmental factors. We can support the population by supporting the environment and giving them the best chance possible."" The struggles of the charismatic population of orcas that frequent the waters between Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia have been well documented - including in 2018, when one grieving mother carried her stillborn calf for 17 days in an apparent effort to mourn or revive it. The southern resident population comprises three clans of whales known as the J, K and L pods. They are socially distinct and even communicate differently from other orca populations, including the nearby northern residents, which are listed as threatened and which primarily range from Vancouver Island up to southeast Alaska. While the southern residents' range overlaps with other populations of killer whales, they haven't regularly interbred in 30 generations, the researchers said. In the 1960s and 1970s, dozens of Pacific Northwest whales were caught for display in marine theme parks. The whale-capture industry argued that there were many orcas in the sea, and that some could be sustainably caught. At least 13 orcas died in the roundups, and 45 were delivered to theme parks around the world - reducing the southern resident population by about 40 percent. The brutality of the captures began to draw public outcry and a lawsuit to stop them in Washington. Today only 73 southern residents remain, according to the Center for Whale Research on Washington state's San Juan Island. That's just two more than in 1971. Of those captured, only one - 56-year-old Lolita, at the Miami Seaquarium - survives. The Seaquarium announced last year it would no longer feature Lolita in shows.

17,"The Associated Press SEATTLE — Big ships entering and leaving Puget Sound will be asked to slow down to reduce underwater noise this fall in an effort to help the Pacific Northwest's critically endangered orcas. Washington state is importing the voluntary slowdown from British Columbia for container ships, tankers, freighters, cruise ships and car carriers coming from the Canadian province, Northwest News Network reported. The optional slowdown is scheduled to run from this coming Monday to Dec. 22 and covers the shipping lanes from Admiralty Inlet by Port Townsend south to Kingston and Mukilteo. ""When large vessels slow their speed they reduce the amount of underwater noise they create, and less underwater noise means better habitat for the endangered Southern Resident killer whales,"" said Rachel Aronson, the program director of Quiet Sound, which is a relatively new, government-funded outfit that organized the slowdown trial. Aronson said most vessels would need to reduce speed by 30 percent to 50 percent over 20 nautical miles. She estimated that participating might add between 10 minutes to an hour of ships' travel time, depending on their usual speed. Aronson said the time period and geographic area for the trial slowdown were chosen because the orcas travel into inland Puget Sound during that time to chase salmon runs. The population of resident killer whales in the waters of the Pacific Northwest and southwestern British Columbia has declined to 73 individuals. Orcas primarily use sound — including echolocation — to hunt for food, orient and communicate. Ship noise can mask the whale calls, effectively blinding the mammals. Canadian and American government agencies have identified physical and acoustic disturbance as one of the key threats to survival of the fish-eating killer whales, along with lack of prey and water pollution. Aronson said a key constituency to win over were the Puget Sound Pilots, who board foreign ships and guide them in and out of Puget Sound ports. ""We're supportive of the initiative and are interested to see whether the measures benefit the whales,"" said Puget Sound Pilots executive director Charles Costanzo.

19,"The following information was released by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): The federal government will invest in multiple programs to protect endangered whales as part of a massive spending bill approved this week and signed by President Biden. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes several provisions that would reduce ship noise and vessel strikes and protect the iconic Southern Resident orcas and other whales. ""Underwater noise pollution from ships is rampant in the ocean, and it threatens the recovery of critically endangered marine mammals, such as Southern Resident orcas and North Atlantic right whales,"" said Regan Nelson, senior oceans advocate for NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). ""This smart new legislation will invest in reducing vessel noise and put the country on a pathway to building ships that are both carbon-free and quiet."" ""We deeply appreciate the leadership of Washington State's Congressional delegation for its amendments to help assure commerce and killer whales can coexist,"" said Port of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman. ""Washington State is rich in marine life, maritime innovation, and ports motivated to incentivize the development of technologies that support the ecology and economy of our region."" ""The critically endangered Southern Resident orcas depend on sound to find and capture their scarce prey as well as to communicate with each other,"" said Nora Nickum, Senior Ocean Policy Manager at the Seattle Aquarium. ""Applying measures like these to monitor underwater noise and quiet the waters will contribute to foraging success and improve their chance of recovery."" ""This legislation fortifies the U.S. Coast Guard's ability to communicate with boaters and commercial mariners in real time and put more space between orcas and vessels much like our partners in Canada are doing,"" said Todd Hass, Special Assistant to the Director at the Puget Sound Partnership. ""We are running out of time to save the Southern Resident orcas, which are in crisis due to threats from pollution, noise, and lack of their primary food salmon,"" said Tara Galuska, Washington State's orca recovery coordinator. ""This legislation will support efforts in our state to address these threats and take us a step much closer to ensuring these incredible creatures are around for a long time. We are very grateful to the Washington Congressional delegation for this important legislation that will help quiet our waterways and ultimately help us protect orcas and other important marine animals."" ""For too long, the shipping industry has flown under the radar when it comes to noise and other pollution streams,"" said Marcie Keever, Oceans and Vessels Program Director at Friends of the Earth. ""These new measures will give Southern Resident orcas and other marine mammals a better chance of survival in the Pacific Northwest."" Specific provisions in the funding package to protect marine mammals include: A grant program to support ports and initiatives like Washington's Quiet Sound program that aim to reduce underwater noise pollution from large vessels that share waters with orcas and other sensitive whales. New technologies that can detect whales in real-time to assist mariners and natural resource managers in taking actions to avoid disturbing or colliding with whales. A new ""Whale Desk"" in Puget Sound that will help the Coast Guard communicate with mariners when necessary to help avoid ship strikes and other vessel disturbances of orcas. Federal government investments in advancing technologies that help quiet ships and other vessels, which contribute the bulk of underwater noise to busy coastal waters. ### The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists.

20," An ambitious plan announced last week to return Lolita , a killer whale held captive for more than a half-century, to her home waters in Washington’s Puget Sound thrilled those who have long advocated for her to be freed from her tank at the Miami Seaquarium. But it also called to mind the release of Keiko — the star of the movie “Free Willy” — more than two decades ago. Keiko's return to his native Iceland vastly improved upon his life in a Mexico City tank, but he failed to adapt to the wild and died five years later.  He is the only orca released after long-term captivity. Advocates say their experience with Keiko will inform how they plan for Lolita's return. But they also stress the differences between their cases. While they hope to bring Lolita — also known as Tokitae, or Toki — to a whale sanctuary among the Pacific Northwest's many islands, she might never again swim freely with her endangered family, including the nearly century-old whale believed to be her mother.  Here's a look at Tokitae's story. ___ HOW DID TOKI WIND UP IN CAPTIVIT Y? Native American tribes revere orcas, considering them their relatives.  White settlers had a different view. Fishermen reviled the “blackfish” as competition for salmon and sometimes shot them. That began to change in 1965, when a man named Ted Griffin bought a killer whale that had been caught in a fisherman's net in British Columbia and towed it to the Seattle waterfront. The whale — Namu — became a sensation. Namu soon died from an infection, but Griffin had set off a craze for capturing the Pacific Northwest's killer whales and training them to perform, as The Seattle Times recounted in a 2018 history. Griffin corralled dozens of orcas off Washington 's Whidbey Island in 1970. Several got caught and drowned when opponents cut the nets, intending to free them. Many orcas remained nearby, declining to leave as their clan members were hauled out of the water. Among those kept was 4-year-old Tokitae, later sold to the Miami Seaquarium. By the early 1970s, at least 13 Northwest orcas had been killed and 45 delivered to theme parks around the world; Toki is the only one still alive. The roundups reduced the Puget Sound resident population by about 40% and helped cause problems with inbreeding that imperil them today. Outrage over the captures helped prompt the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. ___ WHY BRING TOKI HOME? Lolita, now 57, spent decades performing. Last year the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer feature her under an agreement with regulators. The 5,000-pound (2,267-kilogram) animal lives in a tank 80 feet by 35 feet (24 meters by 11 meters) and 20 feet (6 meters) deep. Whales are intelligent, social creatures, and activists have long dreamed of returning Tokitae to her family.  The whale believed to be Toki’s mother is the matriarch of L-pod, one of three clans that make up the so-called southern resident killer whales, a genetically and socially distinct population that frequents the Salish Sea between Washington and British Columbia. There are 73 southern residents remaining. Plans call for bringing Lolita to a netted whale sanctuary of about 15 acres (6 hectares). She would be released into an enclosure the size of a couple football fields within that sanctuary, where she would be under round-the-clock care. “The first objective is to provide her the highest quality of life we can,” said Charles Vinick, a founder of the nonprofit Friends of Toki as well as executive director of the Whale Sanctuary Project. “Whether or not it becomes the dream of having her reunite with L-pod is something we have to rely on Lolita to show us.” Because the southern residents are endangered, advocates would have to obtain additional permits if they ever wanted to return Toki fully to the wild. Advocates would likely have to show that introducing another aging whale to feed wouldn't burden the population further. With financial backing from Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, they have agreed to support Lolita long term, whether she's reintroduced or not. For Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington and a board member of Friends of Toki, the whale's return is fundamental. “Until she’s returned to her family, our family is broken,” Morris said. “When she comes home, the web of life will be repaired and restored, and our people will be repaired and restored.” ___ HOW DO YOU MOVE A 2.5-TON WHALE? When all the pieces are in place — which could take two years — Lolita will be placed on a stretcher. She'll be lifted by crane into a tank placed on a truck, and the truck driven to a cargo plane. She'll be flown to Washington, loaded onto a barge, floated to the sanctuary, and lowered by crane into her new home. Toki's transportation tank will be filled with fresh water — salt water could ruin the plane in the event of a leak. Her caregivers will protect her skin with ointment.  Advocates will work with Washington's Department of Natural Resources to pick the sanctuary site. There, Toki can begin recovering the strength she might need to rejoin wild orcas, to relearn to hunt and to travel around 100 miles (161 kilometers) per day. ___ WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM KEIKO? Keiko was about 2 when he was captured in 1979. He spent time in Iceland and Canada before being sold in 1985 to a theme park in Mexico City, where he lived in a tank filled with tapwater mixed with salt. In 1993 he was featured in “Free Willy,” prompting a campaign by schoolchildren to get him released. A facility was built at the Oregon Coast Aquarium where the emaciated Keiko could recover before his return to Iceland. Keiko gained about 1,000 pounds (453 kilograms) in his first year in Oregon. Vinick, who helped manage Keiko's return, noted that it was always designed as a reintroduction effort. Keiko was in his early 20s — still young for an orca — when he was brought to Iceland in 1998. To teach him to hunt, trainers would launch fish around his pen with a sling shot. Eventually they began escorting him on longer swims in the open ocean. While Keiko would approach wild orcas at times, he would return to his trainers' boat and generally sought out humans. He swam to Norway on his own — a journey of nearly 1,000 miles (1,609 km). But there again he was attracted to boats and people, and he died, apparently of pneumonia, at about age 27. “We already knew how easy it is to capture whales,” Vinick said. “What we learned with Keiko is how difficult it is to put one back.” Malene Simon of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, who conducted a scientific review of Keiko's release, said she was pessimistic about Lolita's chances to learn to hunt after 52 years of being fed by humans. Still, Tokitae has some advantages. She was slightly older when she was captured, so she would have been already learning to hunt, and she might have more memory of her family songs. Further, researchers know who her family is, unlike with Keiko. “It’ll be therapeutic for her, and she’ll get healthier,"" said Howard Garrett, president of the board of the advocacy group Orca Network. ""This is a step toward righting a great wrong that humans have done.""

21,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - This week, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives released the text of the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which includes a historic $54 million for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Puget Sound Geographic Program -- an increase of $19.75 million or 57 percent over Fiscal Year 2022. This investment, combined with a $17.8 million allocation from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, means Puget Sound will receive $71.8 million in federal funds next year to protect irreplaceable habitat. Today, the Senate passed the Omnibus by a vote of 68-29. The House is expected to vote on it this week. EPA Geographic Program Funding will support competitive grants and other projects through the Puget Sound Partnership, Tribes, and other stakeholders to clean up Puget Sound. Funded projects include salmon habitat restoration, toxicology, stormwater mitigation, and investments to improve core science needed to understand and respond to the top threats facing the region. ""This is a historic investment in Puget Sound recovery,"" said Sen. Cantwell ""The creation of the first-ever Puget Sound Recovery National Program office and Puget Sound Federal Task Force will mean that the Puget Sound, salmon, and orcas are poised to receive unprecedented support well into the future. This is critical to conducting the science needed to protect and restore our Sound for future generations."" ""Puget Sound is central to our economy and environment, and it holds major significance to the many Washington state families, Tribes, and communities who count on it to be clean, healthy, and vibrant,"" said Sen. Murray. ""Protecting and restoring the ecosystems and habitats that make Washington state so special is a top priority for me--that's why I'm glad I could help bring home more federal funding so our native wild species--like our salmon-- can thrive, and I'm focused on securing bold investments to make sure we have a healthy Sound for future generations."" ""This $54 million federal investment to protect and restore Puget Sound is a big deal. It's a big deal because generations of friends and neighbors have built their lives on the Sound - but if future generations are going to have the same opportunities, we need the federal government to make a meaningful commitment to protecting our region's most iconic body of water,"" said Rep. Derek Kilmer, Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. ""Together, with Senators Murray and Cantwell, Representative Strickland, the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, and many regional partners, we secured this funding to restore salmon and orca populations, ensure future generations can dig for clams, uphold tribal treaty rights, and so much more."" ""Restoring Puget Sound will strengthen our economy and uphold our Pacific Northwest traditions,"" said Rep. Marilyn Strickland, Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. ""This important investment helps protect our Sound, rebuild its ecosystem, honor tribal treaty rights, and preserve tens of thousands of jobs for years to come."" Puget Sound is an economic driver for the region's more than 4.7 million people and federally recognized Tribes. It is the largest estuary in the United States by volume. In addition to funding included in the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, Senators Cantwell and Murray and Representatives Kilmer and Strickland included the Puget Save Our Sound Act (Puget SOS) in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. The bill establishes a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office within the Environmental Protection Agency and in coordination with NOAA and other federal agencies. The Puget SOS Act would also codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting Puget Sound. The Omnibus funds government programs through September 30, 2023. The text of the bill was released early Tuesday.

22,"SEATTLE (AP) — A plan announced last week to return Lolita, a killer whale held captive for more than a half-century, to her home waters in Washington’s Puget Sound thrilled those who have long advocated for her to be freed from her tank at the Miami Seaquarium. But it also called to mind the release of Keiko — the star of the movie “Free Willy” — more than two decades ago. Keiko's return to his native Iceland improved upon his life in a Mexico City tank, but he failed to adapt to the wild and died five years later. He is the only orca released after long-term captivity. Some of Lolita's former caregivers are warning she could face a similar fate — or that she might not survive a move across the country. But advocates say there are big differences between the cases and that their experience with Keiko will inform how they plan for Lolita's return. While they hope to bring Lolita — also known as Tokitae, or Toki — to a whale sanctuary among the Pacific Northwest's many islands, they know she might never again swim freely with her endangered family, including the nearly century-old whale believed to be her mother. Here's a look at Tokitae's story. ___ HOW DID TOKI WIND UP IN CAPTIVITY? Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest revere orcas, considering them their relatives. White settlers had a different view. Fishermen reviled the “blackfish” as competition for salmon and sometimes shot them. That began to change in 1965, when a man named Ted Griffin bought a killer whale that had been caught in a fisherman's net in British Columbia and towed it to the Seattle waterfront. The whale — Namu — became a sensation. Namu soon died from an infection, but Griffin had set off a craze for capturing the Pacific Northwest's killer whales and training them to perform, as The Seattle Times recounted in a 2018 history. Griffin corralled dozens of orcas off Washington's Whidbey Island in 1970. Several got caught and drowned when opponents cut the nets, intending to free them. Many orcas remained nearby, declining to leave as their clan members were hauled out of the water. Among those kept was 4-year-old Tokitae, later sold to the Miami Seaquarium. By the early 1970s, at least 13 Northwest orcas had been killed and 45 delivered to theme parks around the world; Toki is the only one still alive. The roundups reduced the Puget Sound resident population by about 40% and helped cause problems with inbreeding that imperil them today. Outrage over the captures helped prompt the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. ___ WHY BRING TOKI HOME? Lolita, now 57, spent decades performing. Last year the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer feature her under an agreement with regulators. The 5,000-pound (2,267-kilogram) animal lives in a tank 80 feet by 35 feet (24 meters by 11 meters) and 20 feet (6 meters) deep. Whales are intelligent, social creatures, and activists have long dreamed of returning Tokitae to her family. The whale believed to be Toki’s mother is the matriarch of L-pod, one of three clans that make up the so-called southern resident killer whales, a genetically and socially distinct population that frequents the Salish Sea between Washington and British Columbia. There are 73 southern residents remaining. Plans call for bringing Lolita to a netted whale sanctuary of about 15 acres (6 hectares). She would be released into an enclosure the size of a couple football fields within that sanctuary, where she would be under round-the-clock care. “The first objective is to provide her the highest quality of life we can,” said Charles Vinick, a founder of the nonprofit Friends of Toki as well as executive director of the Whale Sanctuary Project. “Whether or not it becomes the dream of having her reunite with L-pod is something we have to rely on Lolita to show us.” Because the southern residents are endangered, advocates would have to obtain additional permits if they ever wanted to return Toki fully to the wild. Advocates would likely have to show that introducing another aging whale wouldn't further burden the population, which has struggled with a dearth of salmon. With financial backing from Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, they have agreed to support Lolita long term, whether she's reintroduced or not. For Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington and a board member of Friends of Toki, the whale’s return is fundamental. “Until she’s returned to her family, our family is broken,” Morris said. “When she comes home, the web of life will be repaired and restored, and our people will be repaired and restored.” But a group of some of Lolita's former caregivers called Truth 4 Toki announced an online petition Tuesday to keep her in Florida — perhaps at SeaWorld Orlando, where she can live alongside the two Pacific white-sided dolphins she has lived with for the past 30 years. They describe her as a geriatric animal in poor health who has had trouble adjusting to changes as slight as introducing different music into her performance routine. They say the stress of the move could kill her, but if it doesn't, she could be susceptible to pollutants in Puget Sound. “We tried this once with Keiko, and it was an epic failure,"" said Shanna Simpson, who trained Lolita from 2003-09. “This is rainbows and fluffy human feelings. It's going to wind up in Toki's death.” ___ HOW DO YOU MOVE A 2.5-TON WHALE? When all the pieces are in place — which could take two years — and Lolita is deemed healthy enough to move, she would be put on a stretcher. She'd be lifted by crane into a tank placed on a truck, and the truck driven to a cargo plane. She'd be flown to Washington, loaded onto a barge, floated to the sanctuary, and lowered by crane into her new home. Toki's transportation tank would be filled with fresh water — salt water could ruin the plane in the event of a leak. Her caregivers would protect her skin with ointment. Advocates will work with Washington's Department of Natural Resources to pick the sanctuary site. There, Toki can begin recovering the strength she might need to rejoin wild orcas, to relearn to hunt and to travel around 100 miles (161 kilometers) per day, they say. ___ WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM KEIKO? Keiko was about 2 when he was captured in 1979. He spent time in Iceland and Canada before being sold in 1985 to a theme park in Mexico City, where he lived in a tank filled with tap water mixed with salt. In 1993 he was featured in “Free Willy,” prompting a campaign by schoolchildren to get him released. A facility was built at the Oregon Coast Aquarium where the emaciated Keiko could recover before his return to Iceland. Keiko gained about 1,000 pounds (453 kilograms) in his first year in Oregon. Vinick, who helped manage Keiko's return, noted that it was always designed as a reintroduction effort. Keiko was in his early 20s — still young for an orca — when he was brought to Iceland in 1998. To teach him to hunt, trainers would launch fish around his pen with a sling shot. Eventually they began escorting him on longer swims in the open ocean. While Keiko would approach wild orcas at times, he would return to his trainers' boat and generally sought out humans. He swam to Norway on his own — a journey of nearly 1,000 miles (1,609 km). But there again he was attracted to boats and people, and he died, apparently of pneumonia, at about age 27. “We already knew how easy it is to capture whales,” Vinick said. “What we learned with Keiko is how difficult it is to put one back.” Malene Simon of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, who conducted a scientific review of Keiko's release, said she was pessimistic about Lolita's chances to learn to hunt after 52 years of being fed by humans. Still, Tokitae has some potential advantages, advocates say. She was slightly older when she was captured, so she would have been already learning to hunt, and she might have more memory of her family songs. Further, researchers know who her family is, unlike with Keiko. “It’ll be therapeutic for her, and she’ll get healthier,” said Howard Garrett, president of the board of the advocacy group Orca Network. “This is a step toward righting a great wrong that humans have done.” Classification Language: ENGLISH Document-Type: Spot Development Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: MARINE MAMMALS (92%); MAMMALS (89%); WILDLIFE (79%); AGREEMENTS (78%); DEATH & DYING (78%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (78%); INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (77%); NATIVE AMERICANS (75%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (73%); MARINE CONSERVATION (73%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (73%); FISHES (71%); ISLANDS & REEFS (71%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (66%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (60%); Lolita Tokitae Free Willy orca killer whale (%); Animals (%); Whales (%); General news (%); Arts and entertainment (%) Industry: PRESS AGENCY RELEASES (90%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (78%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (73%); MARINE CONSERVATION (73%); PARKS & PLAYGROUNDS (66%) Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (93%); MIAMI, FL, USA (92%); WASHINGTON, USA (94%); NORTHWEST USA (93%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%); UNITED STATES (93%); ICELAND (91%); MEXICO (79%); Iceland; Miami; District of Columbia; Puget Sound"

24,"Whidbey nonprofits and organizations are teaming up to educate members of the public on how they can do their part to help endangered orcas. Orca Recovery Day is Oct. 15. This year will be the fifth annual celebration of the regional event, coordinated by the Whidbey Island Conservation District and its partners throughout the Puget Sound area. Allison Rinard, community engagement manager for the conservation district, said as Chinook salmon populations decline due to habitat loss, climate change and increased pollution, Southern Resident orcas suffer from the increasing scarcity of their primary food source. Hope remains for orcas, however; Rinard said salmon runs increased during the pandemic, which bodes well for the local orca pod. Residents of the Puget Sound region can capitalize on this positive turn of events by taking action to preserve the environment, such as planting native trees and shrubs, cleaning up trash on roads and beaches, expanding green space by their homes or offices or donating to organizations working to preserve marine habitats. ""There's strength in numbers,"" Rinard wrote in an email. ""With all of us working together, there's still time to save our orcas."" Whidbey residents can learn more about how to aid Southern Resident orcas at a number of educational events taking place on Orca Recovery Day and at other times throughout the month. At 9:30 a.m. Oct. 13, Washington State Parks is collaborating with the Coupeville library to put on a special Ranger Reads program highlighting orcas and their environments. The Coupeville library maintains rain gardens that manage stormwater to make it safer and cleaner for orcas and other marine life. At another event taking place at the Coupeville library, participants can help the Whidbey Island Conservation District to rejuvenate the library's rain garden and add pollinator habitat while learning about sustainable gardening practices from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 15. Another rain garden work party will take place from 12 to 2 p.m. Oct. 15 at Greenbank Farm. Then from 2 to 4 p.m., master gardeners will give a presentation on sustainable gardening practice called ""Orca and Salmon Health Start Uphill."" Throughout the afternoon, WSU Extension Master Gardener volunteers will be available to answer gardening questions. Those interested in volunteering can also join Northwest Straits Foundation and Island County Marine Resources Committee from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Oct. 15 at 200 Cornet Bay Road on North Whidbey to remove weeds and spread mulch on the shoreline. Volunteers will have the opportunity to go on a walking tour of the restoration sites at Cornet Bay to learn about how restoration efforts benefit orcas. Then, from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. the same day, Lisa Kaufman from Northwest Straits Foundation will lead an educational walk from the Cornet Bay restoration site to Hoypus Point, where the foundation and the marine resources committee are removing 350 feet of shoreline armor to restore nearshore processes to benefit forage fish, salmon and orcas. On the South End, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. Oct. 15, folks can visit the Langley Whale Center to pledge to assist with recovery efforts before joining the Orca Network for a cleanup at Double Bluff Beach. History will come to life from 1 to 4:30 p.m. on Orca Recovery Day at the Island County Historical Museum, where 15 participants ages 16 and older may take part in a workshop on southern resident orca captures in the 1960s and 70s. Participants will hear a presentation from Orca Network President Howard Garrett and can participate in painting and writing exercises with artist Jeanne Dodds and writer Miranda Mellis. From 3:30 to 5 p.m. Oct. 15 at Fort Casey State Park, Whidbey residents can observe the NOAA Marine Debris Survey Program in action. Volunteers with Sound Water Stewards, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island and WSU Extension will collect data for the survey while hosting an information booth for visitors. This event will feature hands-on, family friendly activities and a tank of live barnacles. Later in the month, the Blue Fox Drive-In will host the Orca Network for an event on orcas and salmon, featuring activities for all ages, information booths and a documentary screening.

25,"(TNSgov) -- The Center for Biological Diversity issued the following news release on April 18, 2023: A bill to create a 1,000-yard buffer around the critically endangered Southern Resident orcas is headed to Gov. Jay Inslee's desk for his signature after clearing a final legislative hurdle on Monday. Senate Bill 5371 requires that boaters stay 1,000 yards away from Southern Residents, beginning in 2025. National and regional conservation groups and environmental experts celebrated the bill's passage and encouraged boaters to take the voluntary pledge at givethemspace.org until the law takes effect. The Senate bill was sponsored by Sen. Liz Lovelett (D-Anacortes) and championed by Rep. Debra Lekanoff (D-Bow) during negotiations. The original House companion bill was sponsored by Rep. Liz Berry (D-Seattle). ""Our constituents have been loud and clear in voicing strong support for taking the hard but necessary steps to protect our iconic resident orcas from extinction,"" said Lovelett. ""SB 5371 has passed with overwhelming support and shows our commitment to the survival of these beloved creatures who are emblematic of the health of the Salish Sea. I'm proud to have worked with my colleagues to bring a voice to these animals as they fight to survive and thrive."" The law implements a recommendation from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife based on recent science showing that when vessels approach closer than 1,000 yards it significantly reduces the whales' ability to find and catch prey. The harm from noise and disturbance is more pronounced on females, who abandon hunts when vessels approach closer than 400 yards. Currently, commercial whale-watching operators are required to stay 1,000 yards away from Southern Residents most of the year, while other boaters are allowed to approach as close as 300 yards. The new law resolves that difference. Having one distance for all boaters will give the whales the space they need to forage successfully and be easier to communicate, comply with and enforce. The Southern Resident orca population currently consists of 73 individuals, nearing their historical low of 71. ""There are seven calves under five years of age in the population, including Tahlequah's newest calf, and five of those are female,"" said Donna Sandstrom, director of The Whale Trail. ""The future of the population is here. Their ability to survive and thrive into adulthood depends on the actions that we take today."" ""The legislation is a strong step forward. We are grateful to the bill's champions from the 40th District, Sen. Lovelett and Rep. Lekanoff, as well as WDFW and the many scientists, organizations, Tribes, local governments, and members of the public who stepped up for the Southern Residents in this legislative session,"" said Lovel Pratt, marine protection and policy director at Friends of the San Juans. ""Public support for this bill was overwhelming."" Boaters are encouraged to take the pledge at givethemspace.org to stay 1,000 yards away from the Southern Residents voluntarily. Nearly 200 people have taken the pledge since the campaign was launched in September 2020. ""Even though the distance requirement won't be mandatory until 2025, there's no reason to wait to give the whales the space they need,"" said Michael Jasny, director of marine mammal protection at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Our goal is that every boater in Puget Sound, and through the Southern Resident orcas' range, will take this pledge, and do their part to give the whales the space they need, even before it is required,"" said Rein Attemann, Puget Sound campaign manager at Washington Conservation Action. ""Boaters have a unique opportunity to play a role in the Southern Residents' recovery, simply by avoiding them while at sea, and making it easier for the whales to find and catch their prey."" ""Making it easier for orcas to find and catch their food is one thing we can do right now to provide relief for these struggling pods. This bill will help immensely,"" said Sophia Ressler, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""The Southern Resident orcas have been brought to the edge of extinction from human-caused threats including lack of prey, accumulations of poisons in their bodies, and stress and noise from vessels."" ""On the long road to recover the Southern Residents, Washington state has taken a big step forward,"" said Nora Nickum, senior ocean policy manager at the Seattle Aquarium. ""We encourage the federal governments of Canada and the United States to follow suit and give the whales the space they need throughout their range."" * * * Original text here: https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/southern-resident-orca-buffer-bill-clears-washington-legislature-2023-04-18/ [Category: Biology] Contact: Lovel Pratt, Friends of the San Juans, 360/298-7225, lovel@sanjuans.org; Kari Birdseye, NRDC, kbirdseye@nrdc.org; Nora Nickum, Seattle Aquarium, 206/556-1830, n.nickum@seattleaquarium.org; Donna Sandstrom, The Whale Trail, 206/919-5397, donna@thewhaletrail.org; Rein Attemann, Washington Conservation Action, 206/631-2625, rein@waconservationaction.org; Sophia Ressler, Center for Biological Diversity, 206/399-4004, sressler@biologicaldiversity.org Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8131016 MSTRUCK Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); BIODIVERSITY (90%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); MARINE MAMMALS (90%); CONSERVATION (89%); ANIMALS (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (77%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (76%); OCEAN HEALTH (76%); COMMERCIAL FISHING (64%) Company: SEA LTD (55%) Organization: CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (93%) Ticker: SE (NYSE) (55%) Industry: NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES (55%); COMMERCIAL FISHING (64%) Person: JAY INSLEE (79%) Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (92%); WASHINGTON, USA (92%); UNITED STATES (93%)"
26,"I've been lucky enough to have spent decades monitoring the salmon-eating Southern Resident Orcas during Island visits in the late fall and early winter. This passion fuels the nearshore protection work I do as the executive director of an organization called Sound Action. If you love orcas, you need to care about eelgrass, forage fish and the salmon the whales need to survive. Unfortunately, herring populations have plummeted. And, less than one percent of juvenile Chinook salmon from Puget Sound streams return as adults. Experts believe this reflects young salmon dying in Puget Sound before they ever reach the ocean. This food web breakdown, combined with larger West Coast salmon impacts due to water quality issues, and dams that kill juvenile salmon and block spawning for adults, means the orcas are starving. More than fifty whales have died or disappeared in recent years, and studies show nearly 70 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage or early calf death, with these losses being linked to the mother's lack of food. We are in a defining moment, and success in the fight to save Puget Sound, the salmon and the orcas requires us to do everything we can to turn the tide towards recovery. Last week was an extravaganza of rising fins and a reminder of all that is on the line. On Monday, Nov. 22, we had our first Southern Resident orca visit as J-Pod and K-Pod passed Dilworth in the late afternoon and Point Robinson after dark. J-Pod was back again the next day, this time with an awesome Point Robinson parade during daylight hours. And then there was the November 25th cetacean trifecta, with marine mammal-eating Transient orcas traveling north in Colvos while J Pod traveled south along the East Passage — this time with a Humpback whale that traveled the entire distance with them. But the cherry on top was hundreds of islanders sharing the thrill of watching the whales from shore. Some people let out whoops when they see the orcas, and some shed tears. But everyone leaves the experience changed. This is why in addition to our regional work, Sound Action has a modest fee-based subscription service called the Pod Blast to let people know when the whales are here and help with land-based viewing. To learn more, visit soundaction.org/podblast. We have worked hard to keep the annual subscription fee low, but no one will ever be turned away, so if the subscription fee is a financial burden, please contact us at info@soundaction.org Amy Carey is the executive director of Sound Action, a Puget Sound watchdog group working to protect vital nearshore habitat and species.

27,"Ships passing through the Puget Sound near Seattle are being asked to slow down to protect endangered orcas. A two-month trial aims to reduce the impact of underwater noise on local Southern Resident killer whales.  The sound of passing ships can disrupt the endangered marine mammal's ability to hunt. The captains of container ships, ferries, and fuel tankers passing through the Puget Sound near Seattle will be asked slow down this fall, in order to protect the region's highly endangered population of orcas. Under a trial, organized by a government-funded initiative Quiet Sound, large ships will be asked to voluntarily cut their speed by between 30-50%, as they pass through a 20-mile stretch of the shipping lane, the NorthWest News Network first reported.  The aim is to reduce the amount of noise, and therefore sound disturbance caused to the local population of Southern Resident orcas, also known as Southern Resident killer whales. The species, which live in social pods, rely on echolocation for navigation and hunting, which can be disrupted by the noise from large ships passing. ""When large vessels slow their speed they reduce the amount of underwater noise they create and less underwater noise means better habitat for the endangered Southern Resident killer whales,"" Rachel Aronson, the program director of Quiet Sound, told the NW News Network.  The slowdown could add between 10 minutes to an hour onto the travel time of participating ships, Aronson told the Washington Post. The trial will initially run from October 24 to December 22, per Quiet Sound.  Quiet Sound was launched in June 2021 with the aim of understanding and minimizing the impact of large container ships on Washington State's population of Southern Resident killer whales.  There were just 74 Southern Resident killer whales remaining in the wild, as of December 2020, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The trial is influenced by a similar program introduced by The Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, in Canada, per the NW News Network.  Quiet Sound did not immediately respond to Insider's request for further comment, made outside normal working hours.

28,"Experiment's goal: Learn where ships should be quieter ABOARD THE SOUNDGUARDIAN, Puget Sound - Over the side it goes with a splash: three ears pricked for the sounds of orcas, and the noise that threatens their survival. In the deep, this trio of hydrophones rests on the sea bottom, recording the sounds of Washington's Puget Sound, including endangered southern resident orcas. The listening array, developed and deployed by SMRU Consulting, is attached to a buoy that marks its location just about a mile offshore, north of Carkeek Park. The equipment will be in place for three months, in a proof-of-concept experiment to determine if the hydrophones and software can readily pick up the sounds of orcas, record underwater noise and share the data through a cellular transmitter, The Seattle Times reported. If it all works, listening arrays like this can supplement orca sightings by human observers reported on existing networks, already being used by the Washington State Ferries to steer clear of the killer whales. Ultimately, the hope is to deploy multiple arrays in Puget Sound to alert ships to the presence of orcas, so they may voluntarily slow their engines to cut their noise, or change course. A slower and more distant ship is a quieter ship - and that matters to orcas. With now only 74 orcas in the J, K and L pods, the southern residents are among the rarest whales in the world. There are at least three threats to their survival: lack of chinook salmon, their favorite food; pollution; and noise that makes it harder for them to hunt. Orcas hunt by echolocation - sophisticated biosonar by which they locate, chase and nail their prey. But the noise of ships masks the sounds they need to hear to hunt. The Port of Vancouver in British Columbia already has a program in place to help quiet the waters it shares with whales. The port in 2017 launched its ECHO program, which includes a voluntary slowdown for ships in Haro Strait and Boundary Pass. In 2021, the cumulative voluntary participation rate by the marine transportation industry was 90 percent on transits in Haro Strait and Boundary Pass, reducing underwater noise intensity by 50 percent, according to ECHO program reports by the Port of Vancouver and Vancouver Fraser Port Authority. A sister program called Quiet Sound - a project of Washington Maritime Blue, a Seattle nonprofit - is in the works. The Quiet Sound program is in its initial stages and includes several efforts, from technology development to eventually implementing a slowdown zone in central Puget Sound, said Rachel Aronson, the program director. Quiet Sound launched in January with $600,000 from state and federal agencies, ports and foundations. The program grew out of a recommendation from the orca task force empaneled by Gov. Jay Inslee in 2018. A first step toward a vessel-slowdown initiative is a field trial for the hydrophones to help determine when orcas are in the area. So on a recent morning, Jason Wood, managing director at SMRU, was out on the SoundGuardian, King County's environmental research vessel, to check on the equipment. Wood worked with Bob Kruger and other crew members to haul the device aboard, replace its batteries and check it over. Then Kruger helped lower the equipment, weighing about a ton, back into the water with an overhead crane, setting it gently on the bottom. No southern residents have been picked up on the device yet. Efforts to quiet the waters come as the Salish Sea is poised to see more vessel traffic. Issues with the global supply chain and cargo congestion at ports recently have caused a big increase in the number of container ships and bulk carriers sitting at anchor, including in the Salish Sea. In addition, 22 new or expanding terminal and refinery projects have been proposed, permitted or recently completed that will increase vessel traffic, according to a 2021 report by Lovel Pratt, marine protection and policy director for Friends of the San Juans, an environmental nonprofit. Twelve of the 22 projects would add at least 2,634 annual vessel transits to and from Salish Sea ports in British Columbia.

29,"Link to Image Link to Story A 57-year-old orca whale, known as Lolita or Tokitae, may soon have a chance at a new life of freedom after spending most of her life in captivity. Lolita was only about four years old when she was captured in Washington state's Puget Sound during a deadly round-up of the creatures in 1970. She has since been performing for paying crowds in a theme park, but her health began to suffer in recent years. Now, there is hope for Lolita's release into the open ocean, thanks to a new agreement signed between the theme park that keeps her and an animal rights group. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has teamed up with The Dolphin Company, which owns the Seaquarium where Lolita resides, and the Florida non-profit Friends of Toki, co-founded by environmentalist Pritam Singh. The agreement aims to give Lolita a chance to swim freely in the open ocean within 18 to 24 months. However, the deal still faces hurdles to gain government approval, and the cost could reach $20 million. There are also concerns that Lolita could bring diseases from captivity with her to the wild. If Lolita is to be released, she will need to be taught to fish and build up her muscles in an ocean sanctuary. Orcas typically swim about 160km per day, making the transition from a small tank to the open ocean a significant challenge. Lolita will also need to be reunited with her family, which could be difficult since she was taken at such a young age. Lolita's mother, Ocean Sun, is more than 90 years old and still swims wild in the area of Puget Sound. According to Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington who also serves on the board of Friends of Toki, Lolita was learning to hunt when she was taken from her family. Morris adds that Lolita still knows her family song and will remember her family, but it will take time. Lolita currently lives in a tank that measures 24 metres in length, 11 metres wide, and six metres deep. The push to free Lolita gained momentum after the 2013 documentary Blackfish highlighted the captivity of orcas and the impact on their well-being. The agreement between Irsay, The Dolphin Company, and Friends of Toki offers hope for Lolita to experience a better life after decades in captivity.

30,"This week the endangered southern resident orcas made their first fall foray this year into inland Puget Sound, according to a press release from the Orca Network. The Whidbey Island-based nonprofit's whale sighting network confirmed on Tuesday that orcas present in island waters were members of J pod, a family of fish-eating orcas whose main food source is salmon, primarily Chinook. With the region enveloped in dense fog, achieving a proper headcount was challenging and made confirming ecotype difficult. Late in the morning, Washington State Ferries first reported to vessel Orca Network 2 that there were northbound orcas seen on the Edmonds/Kingston route. Mid-afternoon brought the next reports of about seven southbound orcas that traveled as far south as South Bainbridge Island before turning back to travel north. With a group of Bigg's orcas inland just days prior and reports hovering around seven orcas, it was still unclear which were present. Whale Sighting Network Coordinator Alisa Lemire Brooks met the lead whales just as they arrived off Shilshole Marina/Golden Gardens. As more and more orcas arrived, widely spread in all directions, it became clear they were endangered Southern Residents. In the fall, after spending summers foraging for salmon out in the Pacific and more northern waterways in the Salish Sea, southern resident orcas travel further inland to their Puget Sound habitat following the fall and early winter salmon runs, an important food source for them. Brooks noted that the scene with the orcas was beautiful ""under an early October sky as the setting sun nestled in behind the Olympic Mountain range."" ""The anticipation in the local community this time of year is palpable,"" she said. ""We are so fortunate to live in such a remarkably beautiful place with a plethora of nearby shorelines to watch these majestic, intelligent, social beings. It's always a gift to say hello in person to familiar orcas as they travel this urban part of their home range in search of food they are dependent upon. It is heart-warming to watch matriarchs lead their families while calves spend time spy-hopping, tail lobbing and rolling around, and older family members forage and socialize, including the adult and sub-adult males who often flank the sides and rear."" J pod stayed overnight in Puget Sound. By evening of Oct. 5, the pod slowly made its way up Admiralty Inlet, leaving Puget Sound for now, and showed up off the west side of San Juan Island early morning on Oct. 6. Fall and early winter months offer many opportunities to observe J, K and L pods along the many miles of shoreline. Whidbey Island, the Kitsap and Olympic Peninsulas and the inland waters of Puget Sound proper offer wonderful public viewing options from shore. For 21 years, Orca Network's Whale Sighting Network has encouraged whale-watching from shore and other platforms such as Washington State Ferries. A public interactive viewpoints map assists people in finding a land-based place to watch whales. The map can be found on Orca Network's website and Facebook page.

31,"SEATTLE - The killer whales that spend time in the inland waters of Washington state already are tagged and tracked, photographed and measured. Researchers follow them by drone and by sea, analyzing their waste and their exhaled breath. Now, experts want to add another layer to the exhaustive studies: individual health records for each endangered whale. The records would take existing research on the creatures and combine it in one place. The idea is to use them to monitor the orcas' health trends individually and as a population. It's similar to people having one medical record as they move from one doctor to the next or between specialists. Eighty-four orcas typically appear in Puget Sound from spring to fall. ""The goal is to really start getting a lot of data and pull them together in a way that permits easier analysis,"" said Joe Gaydos, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of California, Davis, and chief scientist with the SeaDoc Society, which is part of the university's School of Veterinary Medicine. ""Ultimately, the real benefit of any health record is to help make (management) decisions,"" he added. For example, if an orca appears emaciated or is in bad shape during certain times of the year, wildlife managers can access the animal's health history to see what's going on and what they could do about it, he said. Understanding the factors that affect an orca's health will ultimately help pinpoint the key threats and how to reduce them, experts say. ""It will be really powerful to rule out things that aren't important and focus in on what's really important,"" said Lynne Barre with NOAA Fisheries. She said that will help inform research and management decisions in the long run. The project aims to pull together data on behaviour, reproductive success, skin diseases and other study areas to allow for integrated analysis, she said. Scientists have enough data that they can now connect the dots to get meaningful answers, said Brad Hanson, an NOAA Fisheries wildlife biologist. More than two dozen wildlife experts met in Seattle on Tuesday to develop plans for health records for the orcas. The meeting was sponsored by SeaDoc Society, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries and the National Marine Mammal Foundation. Many details are still being worked out, including who will maintain the data and how people will access it. But an initial database would be launched this summer using readily available information, such as sex, age, gender and other details, Gaydos said. Other information would be added next year. Elsewhere, scientists have studied individual animals to monitor their health, including North Atlantic right whales. Using a database of hundreds of thousands of photographs taken over decades, researchers at the New England Aquarium and others have studied the body and skin conditions of about 400 individual right whales to assess their health. Individual Puget Sound orcas are identified by unique black and white markings or variations in their fin shapes, and each whale is given a number and a name. The Center for Whale Research on San Juan Island keeps the federal government's annual census on the population. The three families - the J, K, and L pods - are genetically and behaviourally distinct from other killer whales. They use unique calls to communicate with one another and eat salmon rather than marine mammals. Their numbers have fluctuated in recent decades as they have faced threats from pollution, lack of prey and disturbance from boats. They were listed as endangered in 2005.

33,"Oct. 8—Endangered Southern Resident orcas from J pod were seen this week in Puget Sound. Initially the dense fog in the area made it difficult Tuesday for Orca Network Whale Sighting Network staff to confirm the number and type of whales. Orca Whale Sightings Network Coordinator Alisa Lemire Brooks said she met the whales near Shilshole Bay Marina in Seattle to get a clear count and confirmed they were members of J pod. Up to seven were seen together, but Lemire Brooks was able to see whales spanning up to two miles, which meant it was likely all of J pod. ""It's always a gift to say hello in person to familiar orcas as they travel this urban part of their home range in search of food they are dependent upon,"" Lemire Brooks said. Southern Resident orcas move into Puget Sound during the fall and early winter months to follow the winter salmon runs. The salmon, mainly chinook, make up 80% of their diet. During the warmer months, the pod travels throughout the Salish Sea, visiting Puget Sound, the San Juan Islands and Georgia Strait. J pod swam as far south as Bainbridge Island before heading north and staying in Puget Sound overnight. On Wednesday, the pod made its way up to Admiralty Inlet and early on Thursday was seen west of San Juan Island. J pod is one of three Southern Resident pods found in the area. A census done July 1 by the Center of Whale Research counted 73 orcas between J, K and L pods. In 2021 there were 74 whales in the three pods. For the next few months, whale watchers can see J, K and L pods from Whidbey Island, the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas, the inland shore of Puget Sound and while on ferries. The public is asked to send whale sightings to sightings@orcanetwork.org, message the Orca Network Facebook page, call 360-331-3543 or visit the Orca Network website.

34,"Two more orcas that are part of a critically endangered population are expected to die by this summer, according to the population's lead demographer. Photos taken on New Year's Eve of a 42-year-old female known as J17 show she has a condition known as peanut head that is caused by starvation. Her head and neck are misshapen, said Ken Balcomb, founding director of the Center for Whale Research.  Another whale, 27-year-old K25, also isn't getting enough food. His mother died in 2017, leaving him to forage by himself. ""I am confident we are going to lose them sometime before summer,"" Balcomb said. Older females are known to share food with their sons, said Deborah Giles, research scientist for University of Washington Center for Conservation Biology and research director for nonprofit Wild Orca. ""These large, adult, hungry males benefit by the females in their family,"" Giles said. ""There probably is still family foraging going on, but not like he had when his mom was alive."" J17 is still of child-bearing age, Giles said. The group has seen no successful births in three years. Puget Sound's southern resident orca population is down to 74 whales, its lowest point in 35 years. The chinook salmon populations the whales feed on have dwindled, making it more difficult for them to get enough food. ""I am going to stop counting at 70,"" Balcomb said. ""What is the point?"" The orcas drew public attention last year, when a mother carried her dead newborn calf on her head for more than 1,000 miles (Greenwire, Aug. 13, 2018). A 4-year-old whale that was part of the population also died last year, along with a third orca (Greenwire, Sept. 14, 2018). ""We need bold action,"" Balcomb said.

35,"A coalition of environmental groups filed suit Wednesday to force the government to put the Puget Sound's killer whales on the endangered species list. Killer whales, or orcas, are found in all the world's oceans and are not threatened. But the three pods that live along the Northwest coast are struggling. Their population is down to 82, from a high of about 120 in the 1960s. The National Marine Fisheries Service concluded in June that while the Puget Sound orcas are genetically distinct and could be extinct within a century, they do not constitute a ""significant population segment"" and are not eligible for protection under the Endangered Species Act. ""This is the first time an agency has tried to avoid protecting a species by claiming that the species is insignificant,"" said Kathy Fletcher of People for Puget Sound, one of nine plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The Fisheries Service proposed listing the Puget Sound orcas as a ""depleted species"" under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Under that provision, federal agencies ""still have a duty to avoid injury,"" said the agency's Northwest regional director, Bob Lohn. The lawsuit contends the agency ignored important aspects of killer whale biology and culture. The orcas' decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including declining salmon runs, toxins that accumulate in their bodies, and ship traffic and noise.

36,"The following information was released by Defenders of Wildlife: Kathleen S. Gobush, PhD The Pacific Northwest is home to many wonderful wildlife species. Within the region, the Puget Sound, which is part of the Salish Sea, is the major inlet located in Washington that connects to the Pacific Ocean. The sound is also home to many beloved and unfortunately endangered species including sea otters, chinook salmon and the Southern Resident orca population. One issue that these species encounter comes in the form of creosote that has leached into the water. Creosote, also known as coal tar, was commonly used as a wood preservative to prevent the decay of pilings that support docks and piers in the sound. Creosote is the byproduct of the high temperature treatment of coal to make natural gas and other fuel. It is a thick, viscous dark brown liquid with a strong gaseous odor. Approximately 300 chemicals have been identified in creosote and depending on the processing, as many as 10,000 chemicals may be in the mixture. It is also very proficient at its job: protecting wood from insects and salt water. Creosote has been used since 1851 and although it's now banned for residential use, it is still allowed for some commercial venues. The creosote that has been used to build, preserve and treat piers, docks, telephone poles, railroad ties and floats throughout the Puget Sound have been leaching toxins into the waters, causing detrimental conditions for marine wildlife of all types. Of all the toxins found in creosote, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the chemicals of most concern as they are carcinogenic (cancer-forming) and bioaccumulate very easily in organisms especially long-lived top predators like orcas. When exposed to ultraviolet light or sunshine, the chemicals in creosote become even more toxic and are more likely to leach from the wood. Many species including a variety of birds, amphibians, mammals and fish along the Pacific Northwest coast are affected by the leached creosote. For example, studies have shown that herring eggs exposed to creosote have a high mortality rate exhibiting slowed or stalled embryonic development. Herring are one of the main sources of food for chinook and other salmon species, which are, in turn, important food sources for Southern Resident orcas. In fact, Southern Resident orcas rely on chinook salmon for 50% to 100% of their diets, depending on the season. Studies on PAHs and other chemicals found in creosote show they harm juvenile salmon, stunt growth, deform developing hearts, alter immune systems and harm the fish's reproductive functions. All it takes is for the fish to migrate through a contaminated estuary for it to become contaminated. This toxic cocktail of chemicals from creosote is harmful to people too. Exposure to creosote through direct contact on beaches or even through vapors emitted on hot days can also threaten the health of people nearby. Thousands of derelict creosote pilings remain in Puget Sound which wash up regularly along beaches. Some people unwittingly use creosote-treated wood for beach fires and may even cook food with it. Removing the Risk The main method of reducing the risks of creosote leaching is to manually remove the offending debris and structures that are scattered in and around the Puget Sound. In Washington, there are two primary programs that serve this purpose: the Creosote Piling Removal Program headed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), and the Snohomish County Marine Resource Committee (MRC). The MRC has created a prioritization plan for the potential removal of independent pilings in the Snohomish Estuary. These programs focus their removal efforts on large collections of creosote-treated pilings and, when funding, derelict over-water structures such as piers and docks. Removing the standing piles before they break helps remove the entire source and prevents it from washing up on shorelines further impacting sensitive habitats. Since 2007, the DNR has removed 21,300 tons of creosote enough to cover 8.3 acres of land. Since creosote can wash up just about anywhere, citizen science and observation become imperative. MyCoast is an app developed by the Washington DNR and a few other partners and it allows people to document creosote debris, storm surges, king tides, abandoned boats and other large marine debris. The information collected through MyCoast is used to report creosote pilings that need to be removed, characterize beach change, and comprehend the impact of nearshore hazards to enhance awareness among decision makers and stakeholders. Protecting the Sound is directly tied to protecting, rehabilitating, and recovering our chinook salmon, the southern resident orca, and additional imperiled species such as sea otters and the marbled murrelets (a small endangered seabird that feeds at sea and nests in old growth forests). These species all rely on the waters of the Sound to survive and in turn they play an important part in keeping it vibrant and healthy.

37,"Feb 24, 2019( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex) The crew of the Bell M. Shimada hauled in the net, long as a football field and teeming with life. Scientists, off the coast of Washington for a week on this June research trip, crowded in for a look. Each tow of the net revealed a changing world for chinook salmon, the Pacific Northwest's most famous fish — and the most important prey for the southern-resident killer whales that frequent Puget Sound.There were salmon the scientists expected, although fewer of them. But weirdly also pompano, tropical fish with pretty pink highlights, iridescent as a soap bubble, that were not supposed to be there at all.  What the scientists see each year on this survey underway since 1998 has taken on new importance as oceans warm in the era of climate change. Decadelong cycles of more and less productive ocean conditions for salmon and other sea life are breaking down. The cycles of change are quicker. Novel conditions in the Pacific are the new normal. 'It used to be up, or down.Now, it is sideways,'said physiological ecologist Brian Beckman, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. That's bad news for endangered orcas that rely on salmon for food. When salmon decline, orcas suffer. Lack of access to enough chinook and other salmon where and when they need it intensifies all the other problems Puget Sound's killer whales face. Scientists returned this fish, caught in their survey net, to the sea. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times) On the research vessel Bell M. Shimada, scientists sort a catch from their survey off Washington's coast. The surveys, conducted each June since 1998, help them explore factors influencing the ocean survival of juvenile salmon. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times)The search to understand why Puget Sound's orcas are in decline continues, as scientists probe a range of threats,from inbreeding and disease, to pollution and vessel noise. But a key area of investigation is the primal necessity of regularly available, adequate, quality food.Across the Pacific Northwest, 40 percent of chinook runs already are locally extinct, and a large proportion of the rest that remain are threatened or endangered. Meanwhile, most other marine mammals are surging in population, adding to the competition both southern residents and fishermen face. Now, even the water itselfhas turned hostile. The southern residents evolved to take fish out of a vast area, on the outer coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, and throughout the inland waters of the Salish Sea, connecting the U.S. and Canada. They even come all the way to Seattle's Elliott Bay.Top predators, they can travel 75 miles a day, following the salmon they eat nearly exclusively, since the fish were always so big, so fat, and so plentiful.But in just the past 150 years all that has changed. Humans have altered everything from the climate and the ocean food webto the estuaries and freshwater rivers where salmon begin their perilous years-long journey to sea and back. Despite being listed as a threatened species 20 years ago, the prospects of Puget Sound chinook remain unimproved. How much chinook do southern residents need? Scientists in the Cetacean Research Program atFisheries and Oceans Canada estimate it takes the equivalent of at least 723 chinook to feed the entire population of southern residents every single day— but it could be as many as 868, depending on the age, body size and condition of the whales and the fish. A recovered population of killer whales would need even more fish, perhaps as much as 75 percent more, said Rob Williams, of Oceans Initiative[1], a Seattle-based science nonprofit. Without more food, the whales will be extinct within 100 years, Williams and other colleagues foundin a 2017 paper[2]. 'Let's not kid ourselves, we have a long way to go,' Williams said. A changing ocean Back aboard the Bell M. Shimada, nighttime for some of the scientists was prime time for towing a net alongside the ship to gather samples of zooplankton to assess the ocean's food supply for salmon. The crews got up twice each night,the ship ablaze with lights, to capture tiny animals migrating upward in the water to feed on plankton — the great green pastures of the sea, each individual tiny green life feeding these animals that feed everything else. Researchers aboard the Bell M. Shimada undertake a night survey using nets to capture zooplankton, tiny animals critical to the food chain that ultimately leads all the way to killer whales. (Steve Ringman and Ramon Dompor / The Seattle Times) Held to the light, a jar of seawater comes alive with a sampling of animals caught in the net. These are the tiny lives that feed the forage fish that baby salmon eat — and eat they must, to fatten and grow, before they get eaten by something else. Most juvenile salmon that leave the freshwater river where they hatched don't survive to return as an adult to spawn, because they get eaten first by a predator. If a baby salmon doesn't get bigger than a bird's beak — and fast — it will never live to feed an orca. Scientists want to see four times as many juvenile fish survive as they do in the sea. But ocean conditions haven't been that good in decades. Then, they got even worse. 'When The Blob hit, everything changed,' Beckman said. The Blob, a gigantic mass of warmer-than-normal water off the Pacific Coast, began forming in late 2013. It depleted the ocean's food supply and killed an uncounted multitude of animals, including sea birds and marine mammals.In June 2017, scientists caught so few juvenile chinook they thought there might be holes in the net[3]. Freakish numbers of species, such as pyrosomes, a firm, plastic like tubular animal of subtropic seas, covered the decks. A changing world for chinook salmonAboard the NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada in June, scientists used nets to survey sea life, part of a study of changing ocean conditions and their effects on juvenile salmon. These are some of the animals — native and nonnative species — they hauled aboard. Those most dramatic influences of The Blob are dissipating, said Brian Burke, a supervisory research fish biologist at NOAA's science center and chief scientist on the 2018 survey. Still, in some places where juvenile chinook in past years had been most abundant, very few were caught at all. So powerful are the effects of ocean conditions, they can swing even abundant runs of salmon into dramatic downturns — or provide a bonanza of spectacular bounty. After decades of little change, more than a million chinook came back to the Columbia River system from 2013 to 2015, smashing records and capping 15 years of greatly improved returns. Yet as the full effects of The Blob developed, the runs crashed again. Now forecasts for chinook in 2019 all over the West Coast are even worse. The southern-resident orcas eat only fish, mostly salmon. In winter, as much as half their diet is coho and chum, and even a little steelhead and some lingcod, skate or flatfish. What these predators need the most, however, is chinook. As the ocean becomes even more unpredictable, what will it mean for salmon? 'What if the frequency of these events increases, even if they don't get worse?' Ritchie Graves, chief of the hydropower division for NOAA's Northwest Region, said of The Blob. 'We lost 20 years of investment in improving the status of stocks. We are almost back down to where we were in the bad times of the late 1990s,' years of record-low salmon returns. And as chinook heading back to the Columbia crash, salmon already have been struggling in the great inland sea of Puget Sound, and its rivers.Fewer fish, more demand The Nisqually River slid toward Puget Sound, whirling and sparkling when suddenly, a sleek brown head popped up. The sea lion surfaced with a big chum salmon clamped in its jaws, shaking its head violently, sending chunks of the fish flying. It dived underwater to go get the pieces. Back up in minutes, the sea lion tipped its head back like a sword swallower and downed the rest of its meal. A sea lion rips into a chum salmon swimming home to spawn in the Nisqually River in January. A resurgence of seals, sea lions and even other orcas to the north is a victory for conservation, but also is taking a bite out of the southern resident killer whales' food supply. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times) Sea lions never used to come up this river, said Willie Frank III, a member of the Nisqually Tribal Council. Today, seals and sea lions travel more than 20 miles up the Nisqually after chum. These are not just any fish. These chum are unique, among the latest wintersalmon runs in the state. They are the prime fish the southern-resident orcas are hunting when they come to Central Puget Sound in winter.But this chum run has declined so much tribal members barely get a fishing season anymore, said Frank, whose late father, Billy Frank Jr., was repeatedly arrested in the 1960s and '70s defending the tribe's fishing rights. Frank sees a parallel in the tribal elders and the southern residents, both struggling to find enough fish. 'To see the little ones out there, and their moms, it breaks your heart,' Frank said of the whales. Now, a population boom in marine mammals — other than southern-resident orcas — may be complicating the picture, as everything from seals to sea lions and Alaskan and northern-resident killer whales beat the southern residents and fishermen to the catch.A paper published in 2017[4] was a shocker for many, when Brandon Chasco and other researchers showed that the resurgent population of marine mammals, thanks to the ban on hunting enacted in the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, may havehad unintended consequences. Harbor seals, alert to any movement, are a favorite prey of transient killer whales, which are thriving on abundant food. This group is lounging on Sentinel Rock off Spieden Island, north of San Juan Island. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times)Today, the chinook catch by marine mammals West Coast-wide is up 150 percent from 1975 to 2015, and down 41 percent by anglers. Whether to cull marine mammals is under regionwide debate. But the whales and salmon also confront much bigger problems. The salmon decline began with non-Indian settlement of the Northwest in about 1880. It's not been a unilateral slide. Some runs are in better shape today than during the heyday of unregulated logging, irrigation, mining and industrial discharges to Puget Sound and rivers throughout the Northwest. Hostile Waters: Orcas in Peril[5] https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/hunger-the-decline-of-salmon-adds-to-the-struggle-of-puget-sounds-orcas/st.news/HostileWatersABOUT THIS SERIES[6] In the weeks and months ahead, The Seattle Times' 'Hostile Waters' series will continue to explore and expose the plight of the southern resident killer whales, among the most-enduring symbols of our region and most-endangered animals. We'll examine the role humans have played in their decline, what can be done about it and why it matters. But historic overfishingtook its toll. So do hatcheries releasing hundreds of millions of fish that can compete with wild fish for food and habitat, and even spread disease. Dams impede, and some even wholly block, the rivers in which salmon spawn. Bulkheads harden shorelines. Estuaries and tide flats have been filled. Rivers have been straightened and walled off with dikes and levees. Thousands of inadequate highway culverts block access to miles of spawning habitat. Water withdrawals for irrigation and other uses diminish river flows. A warming climate is boosting summer water temperatures above safe levels for salmon in rivers all over the state. Preliminary findings by a total of 60 nonprofits, universities, tribes, state and federal agencies on both sides of the border in a marine survival study launched by Long Live the Kings and the Pacific Salmon Foundation are revealing devastating trends in the Salish Sea.While coastal stocks of chinook have cycled up and down with ocean conditions, chinook, coho and steelhead in the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound have declined up to tenfold since the 1980s and have remained depressed, the research project is finding. Many salmon die in Puget Sound, victims of everything from pollution to predators to habitat destruction and changes in the food web,long before they ever make it to the open sea. From the orcas' perspective, their food supply has cratered in just a few generations, compared with the historic numbers of fish, their availability across the seasons, and even their size. Brad Hanson, a research wildlife biologist with NOAA's science center, said people forget about how much the baseline for salmon and orcas has shifted, and how fast. 'If you look at all the areas the whales take fish out of, it's a huge swath of North America, all the way to B.C. These animals evolved to depend on all these different stocks,' Hanson said. Today, scientists are concerned about what they call seasonal serial failures:When, from one season to the next, in one river after another, there is not enough food regularly available for the whales. 'If California is bad, and the Columbia is bad, and the Fraser is bad, that takes out six or eight months of the year,' Hanson said. 'You are not going to make it. You are potentially losing calves, or individuals, and that is what we are seeing.' B.C. salmon stocks in general are at just 36 percent of runs in the 1800s, and Puget Sound stocks are also at a fraction of their historic abundance, Oceans Initiative's[7]Williams and his co-authors reported in a 2011 PlosOne paper[8].Farther south, the Columbia River was once the mightiest salmon river in the world, with some 4.5 million chinook a year returning. Now even in a good year, typically less than a million chinook come back. California's Sacramento River salmon runs — once an abundant source of vital winter food — have collapsed.Most Read Local StoriesThere have been fishing reforms,but fishing still takes a toll on the orcas' food supply. Commercial, sport and tribal fishing in all marine waters in the U.S. and Canada reduces the amount of adult 4- and 5-year-old chinook returning to Puget Sound rivers by about 20 percent, according to a 2012study[9] by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Fraser River chinook are depleted by about 15 percent. Even some chinook marketed as abundant, sustainable wild Alaskan salmon may have started their life as a hatchery fish in the Columbia or elsewhere in Washington. That is because most fish leaving Washington waters, especially the Columbia, head northward in their migration, where many are later caught in mixed-stock ocean fisheries. They are never seen in Washington again — except on a plate. Targeted fishing closures may help the southern residents, a panel of scientists concluded in 2017.[10] But their confidence was not high, because whatever one angler doesn't catch may just be caught somewhere else, or eaten by another predator. The researchers put more confidence in reducing vessel disturbance to make fish easier for the whales to locate and catch. How best to quickly get more food to the whales is still under active debate. Salmon abundance is more than a numbers game; it's also about the size of individual fish, and seasonal variety of chinook available for the whales. Over time, that diversity has become greatly reduced.Of 396 populations of chinook that used to be available to southern residents all over the Northwest, 159 today are gone, leaving gaps in the calendar year in which the orcas' preferred prey is no longer available. Chum also are depleted, with 23 of 112 populations no longer there, according to a scientific paper[11] published in 2007.With so much diversity lost, recovering the whale population isn't just a matter of pumping up existing stocks, said Mike Ford, director of the conservation biology division at NOAA's science center in Seattle. For instance, in the Columbia over the past 20 years, fall chinook runs have mostly been doing better than in the previous 60 or 70 years. Yet the whales continue to decline. That's because the southern residentsneed salmon year-round, throughout their home range. And spring chinook — the biggest, fattiest prize — throughout the Northwest are among the most depleted, including in the Columbia and its largest tributary, the Snake River. There's no rescue underway that is right-sized to the southern residents' food problem, said Andrew Trites,professor and director of the Marine Mammal Research Unit at the Institute for Oceans and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver. Fixing just one place or piece of the problem will never save the whales, Trites said. 'They live in a very large house and we need to look at every room.'Size matters, too. For chinook, also called king salmon, big isn't what it used to be. The giants that used to lumber up and down the Columbia and cruise the North Pacific from California to Western Alaska have shrunk, Jan Ohlberger of the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, and other authors found in a 2018 paper published in the journal Fish and Fisheries[12].The researchers documented a widespread trend in both wild and hatchery fish. All are smaller and younger today, researchers have found, examining 85 chinook populations along the West Coast. Coast-wide, the weight of 4-year-old chinook on average dropped by 20 percent from 1975 to 2005, Ohlberger found. Giant salmon such as the legendary June Hogs[13]of the Columbia, tipping the scales at 80 pounds as recently as the 1920s, today exist only in historic photos. A sampling of chinook caught in Washington from 1970 to the present by purse seine and troll gear indicates puny average weights, ranging from around 10 to 15 pounds. That's just a snack for a 6-ton killer whale.Hunger hurts, even kills It comes suddenly: sharp, and unmistakable. A foul, sour, sewer-gas stench. The smell of death. 'That is J50,' said Deborah Giles, resident scientist at the University of Washington Friday Harbor Labs and the science and research director for the nonprofitWild Orca[14]. It was Giles who last summer was among the first to alert NOAA scientists to the declining condition of the J-pod whale, just 3 years old. What Giles smelled that July day, while out on a research survey offshore of San Juan Island with the southern residents, was the foul breath of an animal in compromised health. Over the course of the summer, researchers worried as J50 continued to decline, eventually developing a deformed, emaciated shape known as 'peanut head.' The misshapen head of J50 is a sign of starvation. She died in September, despite efforts in which scientists gave her antibiotics and explored ways to feed her medicated fish. (Courtesy of Katy Foster, taken under NOAA permit 18786-03)By August, NOAA had developed an elaborate, unprecedented rescue plan[15]. For the public, the plight of the young whale had new urgency after watching another southern resident, Tahlequah, swim for more than 1,000 miles carrying her dead calf, which had died shortly after birth, in a dramatic ritual that lasted 17 days. But before J50 could be helped, the whale sank forever out of sight. It was the third death for the southern residents last summer.Why she died is still unknown, and why Tahlequah's mother, J17, now also is failing is a puzzle. Why are some members of the pods so extremely affected? Is it disease? Starvation is not seen throughout the population. But malnutrition is occurring. Researchers began a health assessment of the southern residents using drone photography in 2008, tracking the orcas' body condition in spring and fall. 'There is this growing recognition they are in poor condition presently,' said John Durban of NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla. Drone photos taken by Durban and Holly Fearnbach, of the Seattle-based nonprofit SR3[16], are telling, when compared with the orcas' northern neighbors in B.C. and the waters of southeast Alaska. 'The northern residents are not that far away, and even feed on some of the same salmon runs, but they also have access to different fish,' Durban said. 'It is very different with the southern residents, to look at the shifting baseline. You have to remind yourself what robust looks like.' Transient killer whales that feed on seals are flourishing as well. 'They are very, very robust, fat killer whales,' Durban said. And while both the transients and the northern residents have been steadily reproducing, the southern residents have a high rate of failed pregnancies. In 69 percent of pregnancies tracked from 2008-2014, no live calf was produced, according to a 2017 study[17] led by Sam Wasser, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington. Wasser documented a connection between failed pregnancies and stress hormones in the whales' scat and periods of low salmon abundance in the Columbia and Fraser rivers. Starving whales also burn fat to survive, releasing toxics into their blood where they can do damage to the whales' immune system and reproductive capacity. So hunger hurts. Even kills. Giles, the researcher who sniffed out J50's peril, led the field team of researchers on Wasser's multiyear survey of killer-whale scat. On a trip last July, she followed the whales' fluke prints — large glassy patches on the surface created by the movement of the orcas' tails as they swim along — guided also by the acute nose of Dio, a blue-heeler mix at the bow. Dio the blue heeler and his handler Collette Yee of Conservation Canines search for orca scat in the water off San Juan Island. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times)Handled by trainer Collette Yee, Dio is one of the dogs, all of them rescues, in Wasser's Conservation Canines program, crack environmental detectives trained to track everything from invasive plants to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and grizzly-bear scat. Scientist Deborah Giles examines a sample of orca scat. Researchers have documented a link between stress hormones in orca scat, low salmon availability, and failed pregnancies. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times)Before long, Dio located a particle that looked like a bloated, wet dog kibble. Giles set the scat spinning in a vial in the shipboard centrifuge, for analysis back at the lab. This sample would tell researchers everything, from what the whales were eating, to the orcas' condition and, using DNA analysis, the species of fish. 'Within four days we see the impact if they are not getting enough nutrition,' Giles said. 'Any animal goes through feast and famine, that is normal. But their periods between feast and famine are bigger.' It used to be the whales showed up in the San Juan Islands in May, and were around nearly every day, even in large gatherings known as superpods, with J, K, and L pods all present at once. More typically today, as some of the salmon runs in the Fraser River the orcas feed on have declined, the southern residents arrive much later, and are split up and spread out, with only a few of the families together in any one location. They socialize and rest less, and travel more. Looking for food.A river reborn Now undammed, the Elwha River's spring runoff gave way to clear water by August. An estimated 7,500 chinook came back in an ecosystem-scale recovery feeding everything from bears to orcas. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times)On a stretch of the Elwha River outside Port Angeles, great clouds of insects hummed over spawned-out salmon carcasses. A kingfisher clattered from a branch, and diving ducks flew upriver. Eagles cruised overhead, and a big juicy dragonfly hawked after bugs. Fins cut the water: chinook, battling upriver. Back home from their great journey to the sea.A big male zipped across the channel, chasing off a rival. As the river sang over the clean, graveled bottom, other fish held steady in the current: females, guarding their redds, the telltale pale patches on the river bottom where they had turned over the stones with their tails, digging their nests. While recovery is slow here on the Elwha after the largest dam removal ever, all five species of Pacific salmon are recolonizing every reach of the river. Salmon and orcas are tough survivors, weedy even, surging to reclaim most any place returned to them. After a generation of the southern residents were trapped for aquariums[18], they battled back to a recent population peak of 98 in 1995. Their deaths at timescorrelate with chinook salmon declines[19]. Today, only 75 southern residents survive. But chinook come back. Replacing highway culverts, ripping out dikes to restore estuaries, improving flows in streams— restoration work is going on all over Washington. Crystal Chulik inspects a chinook during scientific sampling at the Bonneville Dam last June. Big fish like this one are what southern resident killer whales need for a square meal. But most chinook are much smaller than they used to be. (Steve Ringman / The Seattle Times)Dam removal is on the table. Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking funding from the Legislature to study the effects of breaching the four Lower Snake River Dams. It will take a wide variety of strategies all over the state to rebuild salmon runs. Some of the region's efforts already have been historic. Beginning in 2011, people did the once unthinkable, and in a grand experiment took out both dams on the Elwha. That opened 70 miles of unspoiled habitat to salmon for the first time in a century. There were doubters of the $350 million investment in the salmon, but the fish are proving them wrong. Last summer, about 7,500 chinook returned to the Elwha, the most in more than a generation. After the Elwha River dams were removed, the chinook came back, along with bears, eagles and even orcas. (Steve Ringman and Ramon Dompor / The Seattle Times) Mel Elofson, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribal member and assistant habitat manager for the tribal fisheries department, picked up an eagle feather from the ground as he watched the fish go upriver last August. With the return of the salmon have come the animals, with tribal members seeing more eagles along the river than anyone could remember. Elofson recently saw a bear eating salmon on the bank of the Elwha. 'It was great to see that bear feeding in broad daylight,' Elofson said. The eagles and the bears aren't the only ones to notice the big kings are back. In August, researcher Ken Balcomb, founding director of the Center for Whale Research, got a call to come document dark dorsals cutting the water offshore of the mouth of the Elwha.

38,"Submitted by the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe. Today the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe took legal action to protect our Sovereign rights in response to the recent ill-informed and overreaching decision by Commissioner Hillary Franz and the Department of Natural Resources to ban sustainable marine net-pen aquaculture in Puget Sound waters. ""As a Tribe, we have always been conscientious stewards of our natural environment and look seven generations ahead in all that we do,"" said W. Ron Allen, CEO and Tribal Chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam. ""Modern, well-regulated aquaculture is the environmentally responsible solution for producing seafood and exercising our Tribal treaty rights – now and into the future."" ""Tragically, population growth, pollution, poor environmental protections and development activities in the Pacific Northwest have negatively impacted our wild fish stocks,"" said Allen. ""We must have options available to take pressure off wild fish stocks through sustainable aquaculture which will aid listed stocks to regain sustainable levels and prevent their extinction."" A vast array of scientific studies have repeatedly shown that well-regulated aquaculture is not an ecological threat to the Puget Sound marine environment. In March 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service released an extensively researched biological opinion that studied marine finfish aquaculture in Puget Sound and found little to no negative impact on Puget Sound marine ecosystems, including native species such as endangered salmon, Orcas, or their habitat. Farmed seafood requires the lowest energy demand of any sourced protein, a fraction of what is required to farm chicken, pork, or beef and produces far less greenhouse gas emissions than land-based agriculture. It seems only natural that Washington would embrace aquaculture as an industry that complements its own natural stock fisheries and allows our State to be a global leader in feeding the planet, and sourcing locally grown seafood in the most climate-friendly way possible. In addition to refusing to respect the science about marine net-pen aquaculture, this decision was highly undemocratic. Commissioner Franz has mistakenly usurped the authority of our Washington State Legislature to make public policy decisions, like the bipartisan bill passed in 2018 which allows native species marine net-pen farming in Washington waters. Fish and shellfish have always been an integral part of S'Klallam culture as subsistence, as well as for the traditions associated with harvest, preparation, and celebration. For millennia, S'Klallam people fed their families with fish and shellfish, and traded their abundant harvest with other Tribes, devising methods for holding fresh catch, and preserving the harvest for future consumption. Our Tribe is desiring to take advantage of 21st-century technology to advance this industry. Food sovereignty, the ability to grow and provide one's own food sources, builds self-reliance, independence, and confidence in our youth and community. That is all in jeopardy now due to Commissioner Franz's announcement to end marine net-pen aquaculture in Puget Sound. By taking legal action today, the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe is strongly defending its sovereign right of self-governance and self-reliance by utilizing marine net-pen aquaculture to provide traditional sustenance and guarantee Tribal food security from our established fishery in our Usual and Accustomed Treaty Area in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea.

39,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Representatives Derek Kilmer (WA-06) and Marilyn Strickland (WA-10), Co-Chairs of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, announced that their legislation, the PUGET SOS Act, passed the House and Senate as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2023. The bill, which President Biden is expected to sign into law this week, aims to enhance the federal government's role and investment in Puget Sound, the nation's largest estuary by volume and the heart of Washington State's identity and economic engine. ""This is good news. Puget Sound is our region's most iconic body of water. It's a place on which generations of friends and neighbors have built their lives and made their livelihoods. But if future generations are going to have those opportunities, we've got to act to protect and restore the Sound,"" said Rep. Derek Kilmer. ""We've been working toward getting the federal government to be a better partner on Puget Sound recovery since then-Representative Denny Heck and I first introduced the PUGET SOS Act in 2015. Together, with Representative Strickland, the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, and many regional partners, we got this done to restore salmon and orca populations, ensure future generations can dig for clams, uphold tribal treaty rights, and so much more."" ""As Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, protecting the Sound has been one of my top priorities,"" said Rep. Strickland. ""Puget Sound is a key natural resource for the South Sound and the entire state, accounting for hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in economic impact. This critical legislation elevates Puget Sound to its rightful place as one of our nation's great marine ecosystems while enhancing our region's ability to honor tribal treaty rights, revitalize our economy, and restore our Sound."" The PUGET SOS Act will help build a stronger partner in the federal government for critical Puget Sound recovery and restoration efforts by establishing a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office in the Environmental Protection Agency to coordinate protection and restoration efforts related to Puget Sound and codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, created through a 2016 Memorandum of Understanding by executive action. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, fiscal year 2023 government funding legislation released today, includes $54 million for the implementation of these provisions. ""EPA appreciates the leadership of Representatives Kilmer, Strickland, and the rest of our strong Puget Sound Recovery Caucus in passing this important legislation,"" said Casey Sixkiller, EPA's Regional Administrator for Region 10. ""The PUGET SOS Act builds on and reinforces the important responsibilities that the federal government has to protect and restore Puget Sound as a national priority ecosystem and our obligations to uphold tribal treaty rights.

41,"An ongoing lawsuit by a Washington State environmental group is threatening to shut down the Southeast Alaska salmon troll fishery in the summer and winter to help endangered Puget Sound orca whales, and has prompted the trollers to ask the City of Sitka to help pony up for legal bills. The Seattle-based group Wild Fish Conservancy filed suit last year and a federal court ruled last August that the National Marine Fisheries Service had violated the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act in approving salmon harvests in the Southeast troll fishery, which catches chinook salmon, a key food source for the Puget Sound orcas. Chinook salmon in Puget Sound are themselves endangered, further complicating the issue. Some of the salmon caught in the troll fishery originate in streams from as far south as the Columbia River, and a very small number come from Puget Sound. There are also fish from other Washington rivers, as well as some from Idaho, and numerous Canadian and Alaska rivers that produce the fish. The fishery is regulated under a U.S./Canadian treaty, and that treaty was re-upped in 2019 for 10 years, and takes into account all U.S. and Canadian fish. The Conservancy argues that 97% of the fish caught in Alaska don't originate here, and although ADF&G, which manages the Alaska fishery, doesn't have exact numbers, they say it is vastly different, and that only 2% of the fish caught in Southeast Alaska originate in Puget Sound. On Aug. 8, 2022, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones ordered that an ""appropriate remedy"" be found, and while that could possibly mean limits on commercial trolling for chinook in Southeast, it will more likely result in a rewrite of the biological opinion about what is causing the problems plaguing the Puget Sound orcas. Some problems pointed out by the Southeast Alaska Trollers Association include rapid urbanization in the Puget Sound area, industrial pollutants in the water, large-scale whale watching, hydroelectric projects, and a popular sport fishery for immature chinook that they say are misleadingly labeled ""black mouths."" In the meantime, lawsuits and rulings are continuing. On Dec. 13, the Magistrate for the U.S. Western Washington District Court released a Report and Recommendation with a proposed order that includes temporarily vacating the Incidental Take Permit (ITS) that allows Southeast Alaska's troll fishery to harvest wild chinook salmon year-round. The National Marine Fisheries Service is currently working to revise the Biological Opinion, including the ITS. On Jan. 10, both sides filed their objections, with the Wild Fish Conservancy saying that the analysis governing the Columbia River in Washington prey increase programs (fishery enhancement) was flawed under federal law and that the ITS covering the Southeast troll fishery was also legally deficient. The Alaska Trollers Association argued that the proposed remedy would have devastating effects on Southeast Alaska and would result in no appreciable benefit to the Puget Sound orcas. Amy Daugherty, director of ATA, told KINY Radio in Juneau, ""it's incomprehensible that the Wildfish Conservancy is looking a thousand miles up the coast to place the blame on the Southeast trolling fishery when there are many other fisheries between Washington and Southeast marine waters. ""Our allocation through treaty has diminished over 50 percent in the last three treaties that we signed with Washington, Oregon and Canada,"" she said. While all the lawsuits are flying, lawyers have to get paid, and ATA has asked the Sitka Assembly to consider contributing $25,000 to the cause. Sitka fisherman Matt Donohoe, president of ATA, told the Assembly on Jan. 10, ""Anyone claiming that Southern Resident killer whales are starving because Alaska trollers were taking food from the mouths of their babies would be laughed out of court. That's what we thought. Yet a judge is recommending that the historic Southeast Alaska troll fishery, which for 100 years has never closed, will shut down this winter. If that happens, the industry will die, and so will a large part of Southeast Alaska's economy."" The Assembly didn't vote on the measure, but acknowledged the economic devastation that would come from a fishery shutdown, and discussion ranged from upping the amount to possibly asking other Southeast communities to pitch in. However, Mayor Steven Eisenbeisz said he was surprised at how much pushback to the idea that Assembly members had been getting from the community at large on the proposal. The Assembly is due to vote on it this week.

42,"Measure aims to help endangered southern residents Soon, boats on Puget Sound will have to stay farther from the area's iconic southern resident killer whales. Gov. Jay Inslee is expected to sign Senate Bill 5371, which would expand the buffer zone between southern resident orcas and boats from 400 to 1,000 yards. Washington's Democrat-dominated Senate passed SB 5371 on a 29-18 party-line vote on Feb. 28, and it passed the House by a bipartisan 95-2 vote on April 11. The importance of the bill, sponsored by Sen. Liz Lovelett, D-Anacortes, revolves around the survival of an endangered Puget Sound orca community, known as the southern residents, which currently number 73 with 25 females capable of reproducing. The area's transient orcas - about 200 in the Salish Sea - are not considered endangered. ""Our desire to see these animals has pushed them to the brink of extinction,"" Lovelett said at a March 15 hearing on the measure. Scientists studying them believe that the beloved orcas have been adversely affected by cacophonic noise under the Salish Sea, and the increased buffer zone may help by keeping noisy boats farther away, according to Tara Galuska, orca recovery coordinator for Inslee's Salmon Recovery Office, and Julie Watson, orca recovery lead for the Washington Fish and Wildlife Department. At times, to a southern resident trying to find prey and communicate with its pod, Puget Sound can resemble a rock concert with the band's amplifiers cranked up to 11, Galuska and Watson said. Southern residents use sound like sonar to find the fish that make up their diet. ""They click a lot to find their prey. When interrupted by other noise, it makes it harder for them to find food,"" Galuska said. Boat and ship engines interfere with the southern residents' batlike sonar. ""When you get animals that rely on echolocation to find prey and each other, and you have boats of all sizes, shapes and speeds in their habitat, it makes it difficult to navigate water, to take care of their young and to find food,"" Lovelett said. In 2019, the Legislature set a 400-yard bubble around the southern residents. In 2022 the state issued 33 warnings and 12 citations to vessels violating the bubble, according to Capt. Alan Myers of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's enforcement division, but scientists say the orcas are still suffering from boat noise. Three orca studies published in 2021 illustrated the ways noise is affecting the southern residents, said a November 2022 report from the state department. Those studies showed that southern residents dove less frequently beneath the surface to hunt for food when boats were within 400 yards. Females would dive less frequently and with less success than males under those conditions. The killer whales also burn off more energy as they stay on the surface when vessels are nearby. These effects occur even when vessels travel at one or two knots, compared to the legal limit of seven knots when in the vicinity of a southern resident. The Fish and Wildlife Department report said work needs to be done on improving foraging conditions - and results - for the southern residents.

43,"MIAMI - More than 50 years after the orca known as Lolita was captured for public display, plans are in place to return her from the Miami Seaquarium to her home waters in the Pacific Northwest, where a nearly century-old, endangered killer whale believed to be her mother still swims. An unlikely coalition involving the theme park's owner, an animal rights group and an NFL owner-philanthropist announced the agreement during a news conference Thursday. ""I'm excited to be a part of Lolita's journey to freedom,"" Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said. ""I know Lolita wants to get to free waters."" Lolita, also known as Tokitae, was about 4 years old when she was captured in Puget Sound in summer 1970, during a time of deadly orca roundups. She spent decades performing for paying crowds before falling ill. Last year, the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer stage shows with her, under an agreement with federal regulators. Lolita - now 57 years old and 5,000 pounds - currently lives in a tank that measures 80 feet by 35 feet and is 20 feet deep. The orca believed to be her mother, called Ocean Sun, continues to swim free with other members of their clan - known as L pod - and is estimated to be more than 90 years old. That has given advocates of her release optimism that Tokitae could still maybe have a long life in the wild. ""It's a step toward restoring our natural environment, fixing what we've messed up with exploitation and development,"" said Howard Garrett, president of the board of the advocacy group Orca Network, based on Washington state's Whidbey Island. ""I think she'll be excited and relieved to be home - it's her old neighborhood."" The agreement among Irsay; Eduardo Albor, who heads The Dolphin Company, which owns the Seaquarium; and the Florida nonprofit Friends of Toki, co-founded by environmentalist Pritam Singh; still faces hurdles to gaining government approval. The time frame for moving the animal could be 18 to 24 months away, the group said, and the cost could reach $20 million. The plan is to transport Lolita by plane to an ocean sanctuary in the waters between Washington and Canada, where she will initially swim inside a large net while trainers and veterinarians teach her how to catch fish. She will also have to build up her muscles, as orcas typically swim about 100 miles per day, said Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington who also serves on the board of Friends of Toki. ""She was 4 when she was taken, so she was learning to hunt. She knows her family song,"" Morris said. ""She'll remember, but it will take time."" The orca would be under 24-hour care until she acclimates to her new surroundings. Caretakers at the Seaquarium are already preparing her for the journey, officials said. The Dolphin Company took ownership of the Seaquarium in 2021. It operates some 27 other parks and habitats in Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Italy. The legacy of the whale roundups of the 1960s and '70s continues to haunt a distinct group of endangered, salmon-eating orcas that are known as the southern resident killer whales and spend much of their time in the waters between Washington and Canada. At least 13 orcas died in the roundups and 45 were delivered to theme parks around the world, reducing the Puget Sound resident population by about 40% and helping cause problems with inbreeding that remain a problem today. Today, only 73 remain in the southern resident population, which comprises three familial groups called pods, according to the Center for Whale Research on Washington state's San Juan Island. That's just two more animals than in 1971. Animal rights advocates, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, have long fought for Tokitae to spend her final years back home in a controlled setting. Activists often protest along the road that runs by the Seaquarium, which they've referred to as an ""abusement park."" PETA says it doesn't want Lolita to suffer the same fate as her partner Hugo, who died in 1980 from a brain aneurysm after ramming his head repeatedly into the tank's walls. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava called the relocation plan historic, saying, ""So many have hoped and prayed for this result for many, many years.""

44,"After more than half a century of performing for the public within the confines of the Miami Seaquarium, the orca dubbed ""Lolita"" will be released back into her native waters in the Pacific Northwest, according to a recent announcement. The plan to release the killer whale was announced last month at a news conference, and was the result of a ""an unlikely coalition involving the theme park's owner, an animal rights group and an NFL owner-philanthropist,"" The Associated Press reported. The owner-philanthropist in the mix is Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay; ""I'm excited to be a part of Lolita's journey to freedom,"" Irsay said, per AP. ""I know Lolita wants to get to free waters."" Lolita's background Lolita, also known as Tokitae or Toki, was captured from the waters of Washington's Puget Sound in 1970 and is currently about 57 years old.  Since being captured ""in one of the last drive hunts for live orcas held in the Pacific Northwest,"" Lolita has spent over five decades in ""an 80-by-35-foot concrete tank at Miami Seaquarium,"" the Miami New Times reported. Lolita is classified as an endangered Southern resident killer whale, ""a genetically and socially distinct population that frequents the Salish Sea between Washington and British Columbia,"" per AP. Of the three remaining Southern resident orca clans, it is believed that one of the orcas in those clans is Lolita's mother. Lolita was only a few years old when she was captured and brought to the Miami Seaquarium to perform in shows for the park's patrons. Before she was a tourist attraction, she swam in a tight-knit pod, as orcas are known to do. Related SeaWorld orca Kayla dies at age 30, and no one knows why. How long do orcas normally live in the wild? When will Lolita be released? The Dolphin Company, who owns the Miami Seaquarium, reached an agreement to release the orca and signed a deal with Friends of Lolita, a Florida nonprofit group, according to NPR. In their announcement of the plan to release Lolita, The Dolphin Company tweeted that the release will happen in the next 18 to 24 months. We are proud to share that the @MiamiSeaquarium has entered into a formal and binding agreement with Friends of Lolita to change Lolita's future. pic.twitter.com/oWWvbIgkFK - The Dolphin Company (@TheDolphinCo_) March 30, 2023 How will Lolita be released? So how exactly does a 7,000 pound orca get transported safely from one end of the United States to the other? It's complicated. The New York Times' reporting outlined some of the key logistical details surrounding the plan to release Lolita: During the news conference, Irsay said that he would help with the costs associated with Lolita's relocation, ""which could rise to eight figures and could require the use of a 747 plane or a C-17 military plane,"" The Times wrote. Irsay also stated that the feat of moving such a large marine animal may include constructing a sanctuary within the Pacific Northwest ocean, and could involve bringing dolphins on the journey, to keep Lolita company, and trainers to help the orca acclimate to her new surroundings. In order to have a chance of survival in the wild, Lolita will need to re-learn ""how to catch fish again,"" Irsay said. ""She doesn't know how to do that anymore. She's been in captivity too long."" Because of Lolita's species' classification, the relocation may require federal approval. Related Why Jane Fonda is campaigning to save 'our brethren in the ocean' Both sides of the argument While the long-awaited, forthcoming release of Lolita is being celebrated by animal rights advocates around the globe, there are some that argue that the orca may not be able to acclimate to her natural environment after spending so much time in captivity. Shanna Simpson, Lolita's former trainer, told Axios that relocating the orca would be ""absolute cruelty."" Simpson's opposition to rehoming Lolita stems from her concerns over dangerous stress levels the voyage may inflict and exposing the orca to ""untreated, polluted water in Puget Sound,"" per Axios. ""I fear that when people see that she's being brought home, people will imagine it's just going to be a sort of Free Willy moment where she swims over and connects with her family. I can't imagine that happening,"" said Jason Colby, a University of Victoria professor and environmental historian, BBC News reported. But, that's not to say the relocation would be a failure. ""If her coming back makes people commit to making sure that this orca family has a healthy place to live then it will be a great success,"" Colby said.

45,"Washington, D.C. - Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) today grilled Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan for his refusal to address toxic dumping in Puget Sound. Following their exchange in today's Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change hearing, Rodgers released the following statement: ""The federal government has already spent millions of dollars to clean up Puget Sound, yet pollution and toxic conditions in the Sound continue to kill fish. Why? Because Governor Inslee and the Biden administration continue to look the other way while municipalities in King County illegally dump millions of gallons of raw sewage into the Sound. Now, Democrats in power want to throw another $89 million at the problem without actually enforcing the water quality standards on the books. This approach will ensure Puget Sound salmon, and the orcas who rely on them for food, continue on a path to extinction. It's time for this administration and all of us to get serious about saving the Sound."" CMR: ""When you talk about laws being clearly violated, I wanted to draw your attention again to Puget Sound in Washington State. This is critical. This is a critical issue to orcas, to endangered salmon, taxpayer outlays, environmental justice. ""You've said that you're committed to cleaning up Puget Sound, but cleanup will continue to be a constant problem if King County and the state continue to look the other way when there's million of gallons of raw sewage being dumped into Puget Sound every year, endangering salmon runs and polluting the waters. ""If you look at Washington State's latest 'State of Salmon' report, Snake River Fall Chinook are approaching their goal and steelhead are making progress, but the Puget Sound Chinook and Steelhead, those stocks that are most important to the Orca, are in crisis. ""EPA's failure to act is eroding three federal efforts: protecting orcas from extinction, safeguarding the salmon that are essential to orca diets, and promoting salmon populations. ""Will you use your ""backstop"" authority to end this excessive sewage dumping by major municipalities?"" Regan: ""What we've done is ... what I believe to be a very strong job of enforcing the consent order that's on the books ... [and] we're going to continue to work with the state to enforce that consent order. ""One of the good things that I can report is thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, we've got about 89 more million dollars to put towards projects like the Puget Sound, so that we can get the cleanup on the trajectory it needs to be. [...] We can't ignore that there has been progress but not enough progress."" CMR: ""The state continues to issue the permits.

46,"Two more Puget Sound orcas are ailing and probably will be dead by summer, according to an expert on the critically endangered population of killer whales that live in the waters of the Pacific Northwest. Drone photography taken this past September showed the ailing population of orcas, known as the southern residents, went into the winter thinner than they were when the whales arrived in the San Juan Islands last summer. They also are thinner than Puget Sound's so-called northern resident population of killer whales, which have been steadily growing in population for the past 40 years in their home waters primarily in northern British Columbia and southeast Alaska, where they have access to more fish and cleaner and quieter water. The northern residents gave birth to 10 new calves last year. The Seattle Times reports Center for Whale Research founding director Ken Balcomb said photos taken of a southern resident orca known as J17 on New Year's Eve showed the 42-year-old female has so-called peanut head - a misshapen head and neck caused by starvation. In addition a 27-year-old male known as K25 is failing, also from lack of sufficient food. He lost his mother, K13, in 2017 and is not successfully foraging on his own. Several southern resident whales were documented to be pregnant in September, but so far there has been no sign of babies. The southern residents have not had a successful pregnancy in three years. The southern resident population is at a 35-year low after three deaths in 2018. There are only 74 left. Losing J17 would be a blow to the southern residents because she is a female still of reproducing age, said Deborah Giles, research scientist for University of Washington Center for Conservation Biology. Giles said she was not surprised to hear about K25. The social dynamics of the southern residents, in which older females help their pod, and especially their sons by sharing food, is both a blessing and a curse if that female dies, Giles said. ""These large, adult, hungry males benefit by the females in their family,"" Giles said. ""There probably is still family foraging going on, but not like he had when his mom was alive."" The coming year is not looking any easier for the southern residents in terms of their food supply. The whales mostly eat chinook salmon. Ocean conditions and poor river migration, with warm water and low flows, have hurt chinook salmon returns in the past several years. Last month, two new areas off Vancouver Island were designated as protected critical habitat for resident killer whales by the Canadian government. Fisheries and Oceans Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said at the time the decision means key foraging locations for the endangered whales are protected from destruction. The government is increasing the amount of protected habitat from about 6,400 square kilometres to roughly 10,700 square kilometres. The new protected area is intended to help recovery efforts for northern and southern resident killer whales, and covers an area off southwestern Vancouver Island. The state of Washington also recently announced US$1.1 billion in spending and a partial whale-watching ban in an attempt to help the population's recovery. The money would go toward protecting and restoring habitat for salmon, boosting production from salmon hatcheries, stormwater cleanup and quieting vessel traffic. - With files from The Canadian Press Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newspaper Subject: MARINE MAMMALS (95%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (90%); STARVATION (90%); CONSERVATION (89%); FISHES (89%); POPULATION GROWTH (89%); AGING (78%); BIOLOGY (78%); CETOLOGY (78%); ECOSYSTEMS & HABITATS (78%); MAMMALOGY (78%); MARINE BIOLOGY (78%); MARINE CONSERVATION (78%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); ZOOLOGY (78%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (74%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (74%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (73%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (73%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (73%) Industry: MARINE CONSERVATION (78%) Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (79%); BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA (92%); WASHINGTON, USA (92%); ONTARIO, CANADA (90%); ALASKA, USA (79%); NORTHWEST USA (79%); CANADA (92%)"

48,"The following information was released by Washington Senator Patty Murray: Historic $54 million investment in proposed Omnibus to help protect orcas, salmon, and valuable habitat Combined with investments in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Puget Sound poised to receive unprecedented federal support This week, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives released the text of the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which includes a historic $54 million for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Puget Sound Geographic Program an increase of $19.75 million or 57 percent over Fiscal Year 2022. This investment, combined with a $17.8 million allocation from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, means Puget Sound will receive $71.8 million in federal funds next year to protect irreplaceable habitat. Today, the Senate passed the Omnibus by a vote of 68-29. The House is expected to vote on it this week. EPA Geographic Program Funding will support competitive grants and other projects through the Puget Sound Partnership, Tribes, and other stakeholders to clean up Puget Sound. Funded projects include salmon habitat restoration, toxicology, stormwater mitigation, and investments to improve core science needed to understand and respond to the top threats facing the region. ""Puget Sound is central to our economy and environment, and it holds major significance to the many Washington state families, Tribes, and communities who count on it to be clean, healthy, and vibrant,"" said Sen. Murray. ""Protecting and restoring the ecosystems and habitats that make Washington state so special is a top priority for methat's why I'm glad I could help bring home more federal funding so our native wild specieslike our salmon can thrive, and I'm focused on securing bold investments to make sure we have a healthy Sound for future generations."" ""This is a historic investment in Puget Sound recovery,"" said Sen. Cantwell ""The creation of the first-ever Puget Sound Recovery National Program office and Puget Sound Federal Task Force will mean that the Puget Sound, salmon, and orcas are poised to receive unprecedented support well into the future. This is critical to conducting the science needed to protect and restore our Sound for future generations."" ""This $54 million federal investment to protect and restore Puget Sound is a big deal. It's a big deal because generations of friends and neighbors have built their lives on the Sound but if future generations are going to have the same opportunities, we need the federal government to make a meaningful commitment to protecting our region's most iconic body of water,"" said Rep. Derek Kilmer, Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. ""Together, with Senators Murray and Cantwell, Representative Strickland, the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, and many regional partners, we secured this funding to restore salmon and orca populations, ensure future generations can dig for clams, uphold tribal treaty rights, and so much more."" ""Restoring Puget Sound will strengthen our economy and uph o ld our Pacific Northwest traditions,"" said Rep. Marilyn Strickland, Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. ""This important investment helps protect our Sound, rebuild its ecosystem, honor tribal treaty rights, and preserve tens of thousands of jobs for years to come."" Puget Sound is an economic driver for the region's more than 4.7 million people and federally recognized Tribes. It is the largest estuary in the United States by volume. In addition to funding included in the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, Senators Murray and Cantwell and Representatives Kilmer and Strickland included the Puget Save Our Sound Act (Puget SOS) in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. The bill establishes a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office within the Environmental Protection Agency and in coordination with NOAA and other federal agencies. The Puget SOS Act would also codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting Puget Sound. The Omnibus funds government programs through September 30, 2023. The text of the bill was released early Tuesday.

49,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 350-80 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The legislation, which now heads to the Senate, includes key provisions to preserve and protect crucial Puget Sound habitat -- and the orcas depending on it. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, authored key provisions of the NDAA that would enhance protections for the Puget Sound, including the Marine Mammal Research and Response Act she introduced last year. ""For the first time, this bill establishes a Puget Sound Office where the EPA, NOAA, and other federal partners will have an annual budget for research and recovery efforts to help clean up Puget Sound. The new law will also require the Coast Guard to review and improve oil spill response plans to ensure we are ready in the event of an oil spill or other pollution event. Lastly, our bill requires NOAA and the Coast Guard to work together to protect orcas and other marine life from vessel traffic impacts including noise, pollution, and ship strikes,"" Sen. Cantwell said. Provisions in the NDAA include: The Puget Sound Save Our Sound Act, which would: * Establish a Puget Sound Recovery National Program office within the Environmental Protection Agency; * Codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of nine federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting the Puget Sound; * Authorize a $50 million annual budget to support Puget Sound recovery under this program. * Provisions to protect Southern resident orcas and marine mammals, including: * A new pilot program to establish a whale desk within the Coast Guard Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Center. The desk would improve coordination between NOAA, the Coast Guard, and the maritime industry to reduce the risk of vessel traffic impacts on Southern resident orcas. This new program, modeled after Canada's Whale Desk, would help track and proactively engage vessel operators to alert them to whale presence, as well as regulations and voluntary guidelines that are in place to protect the whales. * Expansion of near-real time monitoring of large whales to improve management and conservation of endangered species including Northern right whales and orcas. Real time monitoring and the new whale desk will help first responders track and mitigate impacts to orcas from day-to-day vessel traffic and protect them during emergencies, such as the August 2022 oil spill in Friday Harbor. * A $10 million annual competitive grant program to support ports that are proactively working to invest in measures to mitigate vessel impacts and improve conservation of marine mammals. * A $1.5 million annual allocation over five years for NOAA to expand the deployment of ocean noise observation systems for protecting marine life. * A bill introduced by Sen. Cantwell reauthorizing the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Response grant program, which provides competitive grants ?marine?mammals that are sick or injured in U.S. waters. Frequent grant recipients include the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Olympia-based Cascadia Research Collective, and the Friday Harbor-based Whale Museum. Funds have previously been used to support the rehabilitation of sick and injured Southern resident orcas, including Springer. ?This legislation would also: * Create a new emergency financial assistance program to help states, Tribes, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations respond to large scale emergency events, including mass stranding or beaching of marine mammals; * Establish a Marine Mammal Health Map to analyze gaps in data to help scientists better understand how marine mammal populations are impacted by climate change and other impacts; * Launch a National Academy of Science study on the connection between ocean warming events, such as harmful algae blooms, and marine mammal mortality.??? * Provisions enhancing oil spill response operations, including: * Increased vessel response plan evaluations and oil spill response drills; * A Coast Guard study on national, regional, and local oil spill response plans and effectiveness; * A requirement that the best available data be used in oil spill preparedness and response. * A provision authored by Sen. Cantwell to secure $800 million for up to six NOAA weather research aircraft for in order to: * Collect important climate and weather related data to help comminutes prepare for and monitor climate change and extreme weather. * This provision would also prioritize research into atmospheric rivers, which are common in Washington state and cause heavy rainfall. * Direct the Maritime Administration to improve the climate resiliency of our nation's ports. * A bill to improve federal research of bodies of water across the United States, including Puget Sound. The Bolstering Long Term Understanding and Exploration of the Great Lakes, Ocean, Bays and Estuaries, or?""BLUE GLOBE Act"",?would: * Require NOAA to conduct a focused study on future marine and maritime workforce needs; * Mandate that seral cooperative research institutes administered by NOAA prioritize the use of new technology to address current challenges in the ocean environments (for example, new technology and solutions needed to address the collection and removal of plastics in the ocean); * Establish an interagency program designed to provide a comprehensive ""Blue Economy"" assessment of value and impacts of natural resources, maritime industries, coastal communities, and military uses.?? * A requirement that the Maritime Administration, NOAA, and the EPA to conduct a study into the impact of contaminant-laden stormwater runoff on salmon and steelhead trout populations that return to spawn in urban streams across the Pacific Northwest, including: * Evaluating tire-related chemicals in stormwater runoff, and the impact of that runoff on salmon survival; * Providing recommendations for science and management needs to understand and ultimately address tire-related runoff. * A provision establishing Regional Ocean Partnerships to increase collaboration among states on shared ocean and coastal issues, including: * A $2.5 million authorization for the West Coast Ocean Alliance (WCOA), a partnership between Washington, Oregon, California and coastal Indian Tribes; * A $1 million authorization dedicated to supporting Tribal government engagement. The Makah, Quileute, and Quinault Nation Tribes are all members of WCOA. * Crackdowns on illegal fishing and forced labor, including: * A bill improving traceability and intergovernmental coordination needed to catch illegal fishermen on the high seas; * Training requirements for NOAA and Coast Guard personnel to identify instances of forced labor and child labor in the international fishing industry; * Stronger tools for NOAA and the Department of Homeland Security to end illegal fishing and forced labor, including denial of port privileges, improved certification, observer training, and capacity building in countries working to cut down on illegal fishing activity. The NDAA now heads to the Senate, where the bill is expected to be considered next week, before ultimately heading to the President's desk.

The new law will also require the Coast Guard to review and improve oil spill response plans to ensure we are ready in the event of an oil spill or other pollution event. Lastly, our bill requires NOAA and the Coast Guard to work together to protect orcas and other marine life from vessel traffic impacts including noise, pollution, and ship strikes,"" Sen. Cantwell said. Provisions in the NDAA include: * The Puget Sound Save Our Sound Act, which would: * Establish a Puget Sound Recovery National Program office within the Environmental Protection Agency; * Codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of nine federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting the Puget Sound; * Authorize a $50 million annual budget to support Puget Sound recovery under this program. * Provisions to protect Southern resident orcas and marine mammals, including: * A new pilot program to establish a whale desk within the Coast Guard Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Center. The desk would improve coordination between NOAA, the Coast Guard, and the maritime industry to reduce the risk of vessel traffic impacts on Southern resident orcas. This new program, modeled after Canada's Whale Desk, would help track and proactively engage vessel operators to alert them to whale presence, as well as regulations and voluntary guidelines that are in place to protect the whales. * Expansion of near-real time monitoring of large whales to improve management and conservation of endangered species including Northern right whales and orcas. Real time monitoring and the new whale desk will help first responders track and mitigate impacts to orcas from day-to-day vessel traffic and protect them during emergencies, such as the August 2022 oil spill in Friday Harbor. * A $10 million annual competitive grant program to support ports that areproactively working to invest in measures to mitigate vessel impacts and improve conservation of marine mammals. * A $1.5 million annual allocation over five years for NOAA to expand the deployment of ocean noise observation systems for protecting marine life. * A bill introduced by Sen. Cantwell reauthorizing the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Response grant program, which provides competitive grants ?marine?mammals that are sick or injured in U.S. waters. Frequent grant recipients include the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Olympia-based Cascadia Research Collective, and the Friday Harbor-based Whale Museum. Funds have previously been used to support the rehabilitation of sick and injured Southern resident orcas, including Springer. ?This legislation would also: * Create a new emergency financial assistance program to help states, Tribes, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations respond to large scale emergency events, including mass stranding or beaching of marine mammals; * Establish a Marine Mammal Health Map to analyze gaps in data to help scientists better understand how marine mammal populations are impacted by climate change and other impacts; * Launch a National Academy of Science study on the connection between ocean warming events, such as harmful algae blooms, and marine mammal mortality.??? * Provisions enhancing oil spill response operations, including: * Increased vessel response plan evaluations and oil spill response drills; * A Coast Guard study on national, regional, and local oil spill response plans and effectiveness; * A requirement that the best available data be used in oil spill preparedness and response. * A provision authored by Sen.

52,"ABOARD THE SOUNDGUARDIAN, Puget Sound (AP) — Over the side it goes with a splash: three ears pricked for the sounds of orcas, and the noise that threatens their survival. In the deep, this trio of hydrophones rests on the sea bottom, recording the sounds of Washington's Puget Sound, including endangered southern resident orcas. The listening array, developed and deployed by SMRU Consulting, is attached to a buoy that marks its location, just about a mile offshore, north of Carkeek Park. The equipment will be in place for three months, in a proof-of-concept experiment to determine if the hydrophones and software can readily pick up the sounds of orcas, record underwater noise and share the data through a cellular transmitter, The Seattle Times reported. If it all works, listening arrays like this can supplement orca sightings by human observers reported on existing networks, already being used by the Washington State Ferries to steer clear of the killer whales. Ultimately, the hope is to deploy multiple arrays in Puget Sound to alert ships to the presence of orcas, so they may voluntarily slow their engines to cut their noise, or change course. A slower ship and more distant ship is a quieter ship — and that matters to orcas. With now only 74 orcas in the J, K, and L pods, the southern residents are among the rarest whales in the world. There are at least three threats to their survival: lack of Chinook salmon, their favorite food; pollution; and noise that makes it harder for them to hunt. Orcas hunt by echolocation — sophisticated biosonar by which they locate, chase and nail their prey. But the noise of ships, ferries and other underwater racket masks the sounds they need to hear to hunt. The Port of Vancouver in British Columbia already has a program in place to help quiet the waters it shares with whales. The port in 2017 launched its ECHO program, which includes a voluntary slowdown for ships in Haro Strait and Boundary Pass. In 2021, the cumulative voluntary participation rate by the marine transportation industry was 90% on transits in Haro Strait and Boundary Pass, reducing underwater noise intensity by 50%, according to ECHO program reports by the Port of Vancouver and Vancouver Fraser Port Authority. A sister program called Quiet Sound, a project of Washington Maritime Blue, a Seattle nonprofit, is in the works. The Quiet Sound program is in its initial stages and includes several efforts, from technology development to eventually implementing a slowdown zone in central Puget Sound, said Rachel Aronson, the program director. Quiet Sound launched in January with $600,000 from state and federal agencies, ports and foundations. The program grew out of a recommendation from the orca task force empaneled by Gov. Jay Inslee in 2018. A first step toward a vessel slowdown initiative is a field trial for the hydrophones to help determine when orcas are in the area. So on a recent morning, Jason Wood, managing director at SMRU, was out on the SoundGuardian, King County’s environmental research vessel, to check on the equipment. Wood worked with Bob Kruger and other crew members to haul the device aboard, to replace its batteries and check it over. Then Kruger helped lower the equipment, weighing about a ton, back into the water with an overhead crane, setting it gently on the bottom, to keep right on listening. No southern residents have been picked up on the device yet. Efforts to quiet the waters come as the Salish Sea is poised to see more vessel traffic. Issues with the global supply chain and cargo congestion at ports recently have caused a big increase in the number of container ships and bulk carriers sitting at anchor, including in the Salish Sea. In addition, 22 new or expanding terminal and refinery projects have been proposed, permitted or recently completed that will increase vessel traffic, according to a 2021 report by Lovel Pratt, marine protection and policy director for Friends of the San Juans, an environmental nonprofit. Twelve of the 22 projects would add at least 2,634 annual vessel transits to and from Salish Sea ports in British Columbia, in prime summer foraging habitat of the southern resident killer whales. In all, 46% of the projected increase in vessel traffic comes from the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion and the Port of Vancouver’s proposed Roberts Bank Terminal 2, a new container shipping terminal proposed for the Fraser River Delta — where orcas hunt and a crucial Chinook run returns. If all of the proposed, permitted and recently constructed projects in British Columbia are developed, it would result in at least a 25% increase in large, oceangoing commercial vessel traffic, compared with 2020 transits, according to the analysis. Canada’s Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion alone will add 696 annual tug escort transits between the pipeline terminus in Burnaby, B.C., and the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. With human impacts only continuing to increase, noise is one problem that can be immediately addressed, Wood noted. It takes many years to rebuild salmon runs. PCBs were banned in 1979 but are still bleeding into the environment. But slowing a vessel can cut the noise it makes right away. And with enough participants, the effect can make a difference in the orcas’ ability to feed. “It’s pretty amazing,” Wood said of the success so far of the ECHO program. “That noise reduction converts to foraging time the orcas get back.” Classification Language: ENGLISH Document-Type: Spot Development Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: MARINE MAMMALS (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); HARBORS & PORTS (77%); OCEAN ECONOMY (77%); PORT AUTHORITIES (77%); TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (77%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (58%); Exchange-Orca Listening Post (%); Environment (%); Environmental concerns (%); Pollution (%); Noise pollution (%); Dolphins (%); Animals (%); Marine transportation industry (%); Environment and nature (%); Estuaries (%); Business (%); Industrial products and services (%); Transportation and shipping (%); Transportation infrastructure (%); Port operation (%); Technology (%); General news (%) Industry: PRESS AGENCY RELEASES (90%); FERRIES (89%); HARBORS & PORTS (77%); PORT AUTHORITIES (77%); TRANSPORTATION & WAREHOUSING (77%); TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (77%) Person: JAY INSLEE (89%); Jay Inslee, POLITICIAN Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (93%); VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA (93%); WASHINGTON, USA (96%); BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA (94%); UNITED STATES (94%); CANADA (90%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); Canada; British Columbia; Seattle; Puget Sound; North America; United States; Washington"
53,"TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 14 -- University of Washington-Tacoma issued the following news release: The Puget Sound Institute is launching a multi-year, $4.8M effort to enablebetter management actions through an integrated model of the Puget Sound ecosystem.The integrated model powerfully combines five smaller, more specific models of respective ecosystem components. Funded in part by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, the Puget Sound Integrated Modeling Framework (PSIMF) will pull together complementary modeling data from partners including UW's Salish Sea Modeling Center, NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NFSC), the EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), Long Live the Kings (LLTK), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) of Australia. For Journalists Download video, B-roll, photos and model visualizations. ""The Pacific Northwest is home to cutting-edge terrestrial, estuarine, and marine ecosystem models that each have their own use in supporting specific decisions and advancing understanding,"" said Dr. Tessa Francis, lead ecosystem ecologist with UW Tacoma's PSI and principal investigator on the project. ""So far, we haven't been able to link these models together to provide a unified platform with insights into the interconnected nature of our ecosystems."" Francis likened the existing models to separate puzzle pieces that, when put together, will provide a cohesive picture of the entire ecosystem. Human populations and stressors originating from land development and climate change threaten freshwater, nearshore, and estuarine ecosystems. The connections between these areas are poorly understood, and these systems should not be studied one-by-one. Comprehensive data and analyses are needed to make informed conservation, restoration, and development decisions. PSIMF will bring together five models - each of which portrays one aspect of the Puget Sound ecosystem - into an integrated platform providing holistic insights into growth management, shoreline protection, pollution control and species recovery. ""This project links together land cover, freshwater, marine condition, and food-web models, which will greatly benefit the many organizations working to ensure the future of the Puget Sound ecosystem,"" said Scott Redman, program director for Science and Evaluation at the Puget Sound Partnership. ""We look forward to partners using the integrated model to inform their decisions about growth management, shoreline protection, pollution control, and species recovery."" The foundational modeling data to be incorporated into the project include: * VELMA ecohydrological watershed model developed by EPA-ORD * Salish Sea Model from the Salish Sea Modeling Center and PNNL * Atlantis ecosystem model, developed by CSIRO and implemented by LLTK and NOAA's NWFSC * High resolution land cover change model from PSI * Qualitative socio-ecological model coordinated by NOAA's NWFSC Support of VELMA and the Salish Sea Model by EPA's Puget Sound Geographic Program has enabled their individual development to this point, making them ready for use in a coupled framework. ""The integration of these models will create new decision-making tools that positively impact the future of our region,"" said Dr. Gabe Miller, Technology Director on behalf of the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. ""This project reflects the foundation's long-standing commitment to the Pacific Northwest and leveraging data to solve environmental challenges."" Once completed, the project's many linked models will create a fuller picture of the Puget Sound ecosystem, clarifying the relationships between climate, human populations, and land use. This new tool will support regional planning and decision-making, allowing smarter resource management that benefits diverse residents from kelp and fish to orcas and humans.

54,"Thursday event set about effort to 'return' Tokitae SEATTLE - The Miami Seaquarium set a news conference Thursday to announce an initiative among the aquarium's parent company, the owner of the Indianapolis Colts and a Florida nonprofit to ""return beloved orca, Lolita,"" to her home waters. It's unclear if federal agencies have signed off on the proposal, or if the announcement is a promise to finally release the last surviving Puget Sound orca in captivity. Jim Irsay, owner of the NFL's Colts, tweeted Tuesday that he'd be at ""a big press conference"" Thursday ""for a HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT about the future of LOLITA the orca."" Lolita, or Tokitae, was taken from her family, the L pod of southern residents, in Whidbey Island's Penn Cove and sold to the Miami Seaquarium more than five decades ago. That's where she's been holed up since, performing for crowds until recent years. By the mid-1970s, some 270 orcas were estimated to have been captured in the Salish Sea, the transboundary waters between the U.S. and Canada. At least 12 of those orcas died during capture, and more than 50 were kept for captive display. All are now dead but one, Tokitae. A report filed by a federal veterinary medical officer in 2021 detailed multiple violations of animal care standards. Tokitae was given meager rations, fed rotten fish and forced to do high-energy jumps and tricks despite a jaw injury from fast swims, the report stated. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which monitors private aquariums, granted the former owner of the Miami Seaquarium a renewed exhibitor's license under the condition it no longer displays Tokitae. Since then, under an agreement between the Seaquarium and Florida nonprofit Friends of Toki, veterinarians have been working to treat Tokitae's chronic illness, and staff have added water filtration and water chilling systems to her tank. For years, Coast Salish people, politicians and nonprofits have been working to free Tokitae, also known by the Lummi name Sk'aliCh'elh-tenaut. In 2018, Lummi Nation carvers and supporters embarked on a 7,000-mile journey to deliver an orca totem pole to Tokitae. In 2019, two Lummi women invoked the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and announced their intent to sue the Seaquarium if they would not agree to safely bring the whale back home to her family in the Salish Sea. In December, Eduardo Albor, the CEO of the Dolphin Company, the owner of the Miami Seaquarium, said the company is ""100 percent committed"" to her release. But with the proposal comes a long process to ensure her fitness for the journey home.

55,"NWAA Calls on Policymakers to ""Follow the Science"" COVINGTON, WA / ACCESSWIRE / March 2, 2022 / NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service has released a biological opinion regarding marine finfish aquaculture in Puget Sound, finding little to no negative impact on native species such as endangered salmon, Orcas, or their habitat. The NOAA analysis was initiated in October of 2018 to analyze the effects of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of the Washington Department of Ecology's Sediment Management Standards regarding marine finfish rearing facilities. In its analysis, NOAA found that EPA's approval: Is ""not likely to jeopardize the continued existence"" of Puget Sound (PS) and/or Georgia Basin (GB) species, including Chinook salmon, PS steelhead, Hood Canal summer-run chum, PS/GB yelloweye rockfish, or PS/GB bocaccio.Is ""not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated critical habitats for any of the listed species."" In response to this opinion, the Northwest Aquaculture Alliance(NWAA) is calling on regulators and policymakers to follow the science in making key decisions regarding marine aquaculture in Washington waters. Native Steelhead trout grown in Washington State by Cooke Aquaculture Pacific. Photo Credit: Cooke Aquaculture ""After years of meticulous research and study, the scientists at NOAA have concluded, with full scientific certainty, that net-pen aquaculture in Puget Sound is safe for the environment and safe for the endangered species that live in these waters,"" said Jim Parsons, NWAA President. Parsons is also CEO of Jamestown Seafood. ""This study, along with the recent unanimous Washington Supreme Court decision upholding Cooke Aquaculture Pacific's permit to raise native steelhead in Puget Sound, finally puts to rest one of the biggest myths of all: that fish farming has a negative impact on endangered Chinook salmon and Orcas,"" Parsons said. ""As aquatic farmers, we depend on a healthy ecosystem to grow a range of aquatic food products-from steelhead trout to black cod to oysters, clams, mussels, and sea vegetables-instead of importing these foods. Sustainable aquaculture not only produces the nutritious, affordable food our world needs, but it also benefits working families in our rural communities.""

56,"BELLINGHAM - A small environmental nonprofit says it has ""scored a decisive legal victory"" to help protect southern resident killer whales as Phillips 66 looks to expand its fossil-fuel storage facilities in Whatcom County. According to a Friends of the San Juans news release Tuesday, the Washington State Court of Appeals on Feb. 28 upheld a previous court's ruling regarding Phillip 66's planned expansion of its Ferndale refinery. Phillips 66 spokesperson Tim Johnson told The Bellingham Herald in an email that the company does not comment on ongoing litigation. ""The fossil-fuel industry needs to understand that small environmental organizations like ours will stand up to them; big companies don't get to ignore the rules and threaten the endangered Southern Resident orcas just because their pockets are deep,"" Friends of the San Juans Executive Director R. Brent Lyles said in the release. Phillips 66 applied for a permit in 2019 to expand its fuel storage facilities in Ferndale, according to the release, but the application did not include predictions of how many additional vessels were expected to visit the refinery because of the expansion. Scientific research has found that increased vessel traffic in the Salish Sea increases the risks to the southern resident orca, and the release states that facility expansion permits are required to include predictions about how much more traffic can be expected.

57,"It's heartening to see that Lolita the killer whale will soon be returning to Puget Sound and freedom after spending more than 50 years in captivity. Lolita, a.k.a. Toki, who was a member of the L Pod of southern resident orcas that spend most of their time in the waters off Washington and British Columbia, was captured in 1970 when she was just about four years old, at a time when it was acceptable to take these highly intelligent and sociable beings away from their families, stick them in small swimming pools and force them to perform demeaning tricks for people's entertainment. Fortunately, this practice has come under intense scrutiny and criticism in recent years as humans have slowly come to realize just how cruel it is to these most remarkable creatures, and the aquariums that host orcas around the world have come to their senses (added to the fact that they must be seeing income from people who come to view these performances plummet) with many coming up with plans to have them released back into the wild. Friends of Lolita, a not-for-profit organization, and the Miami Seaquarium where Lolita has lived since 1970 in an 80-by-35-foot concrete tank, have announced they plan to return Lolita to the area in Puget Sound where she was captured within the next 18 to 24 months. But Lolita will face many challenges when she returns to her home. It's been more than 50 years since she last saw her pod and family, and she might not remember them (nor they her) if and when they meet each other again. If that happens and she doesn't reconnect with her family, her freedom may be short lived as it's possible she won't remember the skills to hunt and survive in the open ocean and won't survive long, despite the best efforts of the release team to teach her before letting her loose. But, apparently, it's believed that her mother is still alive (orcas can live up to 90 years in the wild) so I would find it hard to believe that such intelligent mammals would forget their own children, no matter how long they've been away. As well, it's encouraging that Lolita got pretty excited when recorded sounds made by her pod communicating with each other were played for her in her tank at Miami Seaquarium, so it appears she recognizes their voices after all this time. Regardless, no matter how well she does in the wild when she's finally released, I think it's just something that has to be done. Such animals should never live in captivity, and that was made very apparent with the story of Tilikum, the orca that killed three of his trainers over his lifetime. He killed them in separate incidents, including one in Victoria's Sealand of the Pacific, before he tragically died of natural causes in 2017 in a Florida aquarium, miles from his home in the deep blue sea near Greenland where he was captured in 1983. I've no doubt Tilikum remembered where he came from and built up a deep resentment for these two-legged beings that forced him to do stupid tricks and, in between these performances, kept him locked up in tiny pools where he could barely move around. Tilikum lived a sad and cruel life and he apparently decided to return the favour to three of his handlers when the opportunities arose. But, in my experience coming across orcas in the wild, they are intelligent, curious and perfectly in tune with their environment, and to have one such as Tilikum become a human killer was an aberration caused by man and captivity. In fact, there is not one documented case of an orca living in the wild killing a person. We live in a part of the world where we're lucky to see these majestic animals in their natural environment right on our doorsteps. Despite their intimidating name, I can say I've never felt frightened or intimated by them in any way when I used to kayak much more than I do these days, and they would sometimes get pretty close to my boat as they curiously checked me out before moving on. Maybe, one day soon, I'll be privileged enough to meet Lolita and her family face to face in the Salish Sea. robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter Copyright 2023 Trail Daily Times Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newspaper Subject: EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); MARINE MAMMALS (91%); WILDLIFE (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); FAMILY (75%); ANIMALS (74%); REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS (74%); MAMMALS (71%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (66%) Industry: ZOOS & AQUARIUMS (77%) Geographic: MIAMI, FL, USA (87%); WASHINGTON, USA (88%)"
58,"If war is how unworldly Americans learn geography, then getting sued by eco-terrorists is apparently how unsuspecting trollers learn Latin. ""Vacatur."" That's Wild Fish Conservancy-speak for, ""We're fixin' to steal your kings!"" Using the scientifically unsupportable premise that Southeast trollers are ""starving"" southern resident killer whales by depriving them of Chinook forage, the Wild Fish Conservancy sued seeking ""vacatur,"" meaning the immediate coerced closure of the Chinook fishery for SE trollers, summer and winter. A final decision rests in the hands of Judge Richard A. Jones in Seattle's U.S. District Court. The WFC lawsuit is a contagion of extremist judicial activism that must be stopped. Before it destroys SE trolling – and before this dangerous legal precedent spreads like a cancer to other fisheries. How to tell the WFC legal fix is in? SE trollers catch vanishingly small numbers of the Chinook stocks that SR killer whales depend upon in their homewaters. Whereas: Marine fishers in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea – where SRKWs spend the vast majority of the year – catch hundreds of times more of these same Chinook. You know, the very Chinook forage that the WFC pretends to care about? But the WFC's position is not just hypocritical. It's scientifically wrong. Chinook abundance is not the problem — for anyone; in fact, Chinook abundance is higher today than it was in the early 1980s. The Chinook fishery is managed coastwide since 1985 by the Pacific Salmon Treaty to provide sustainable Chinook harvests for all members, but also for marine predators — like killer whales. Chinook harvest? Also not the problem; that's what the PST was established to assess and address. The PST determined that all Chinook fisheries (commercial, sport, tribal) are justified and sustainable; SE trollers have seen reduced harvest share over the years — specifically so Chinook stocks could be rebuilt. Every troller I know is a strong advocate for the conservation of the Chinook resource. If science, not feelings, is your guide, no one should have their Chinook fisheries altered. Especially not SE trollers. But somehow, the WFC reckons it knows better than fisheries scientists. Southern resident killer whales are not ""starving"" for lack of Chinook forage; they are unduly stressed in their homewaters. Consider: All other orca populations in the North Pacific are thriving. In fact, the northern resident killer whales have nearly tripled in numbers over the last 40 years. So what's different with SRKWs? The gravest challenges for SRKWs are peculiar to the WFC's Puget Sound homewaters. Things like: In the 1970s, frenzied orca captures deprived Puget Sound of more than 40 SRKWs — suffering death in captivity or killed in capture; more than 20 SRKWs also were abducted from family pods in the Salish Sea. Would SRKW populations be faring much better if 60-plus southern resident orcas hadn't been stolen from their families for the amusement of tourists? Undoubtedly. Or how about the witches' brew of toxins (DDT, PCBs) endemic to Puget Sound that cause miscarriage and birth defects in SRKWs? Or a whale-watching (harassment) industry that has quintipled in size since the 1980s? (Talk about orcas being loved to death.) Or how about the underwater acoustic torture from overwhelming vessel traffic in Puget Sound that interferes with orcas' echolocation — used to prey and communicate — displacing orcas and keeping SRKWs ever on the move? Vessel strikes? (At least four SRKWs killed in the last 20 years.) And the burgeoning sea lion and seal populations? Pinnipeds are at record-high numbers across most ranges, including Puget Sound. Consider: Orcas consume significantly more Chinook annually than all PST jurisdictions combined (orcas eat an estimated 2.5 million Chinook per year in a 2019 study). But: Pinnipeds eat significantly more Chinook than orcas. So if the WFC is serious about blaming the largest predator of Chinook forage in their Puget Sound homewaters, by a lot, they best get a certified letter out to Mr. Whiskers ASAP. Habitat destruction, the damn dams, I could go on, point being: None of the pitfalls of runaway urbanization in Puget Sound are SE trollers' fault. Does the WFC own a mirror? Physician, heal thyself. SE trollers are being scapegoated. Our livelihoods are being threatened based upon a scientifically demonstrable falsehood: We are being blamed for ""starving"" SRKWs when SE trollers are the least-impactful element affecting SRKWs' Chinook forage in Puget Sound. In real terms: Of the Chinook that SRKWs depend upon most in Puget Sound, SE trollers harvest, annually, enough to feed SRKWs for — perhaps a day? Maybe two. SE trollers are emphatically not the problem here. Everyone wants the SRKWs to thrive. I do. The issue is complex. But the WFC seeks to address it in a way that is hypocritical, unjust — and tellingly cruel. So fight this infuriating WFC lawsuit we must. Thankfully, SE communities are galvanizing to confront the threat we face. Commercial trollers are the second-largest fishing fleet in Alaska, and the Chinook harvest accounted for 44% of SE trollers' income last year, with an ex-vessel value north of $12 million. The overall economic impact of trollers having our Chinook fishery stolen (including multiplier effects) is pegged at $85 million for SE coastwide. Despite their expressed ""sympathy,"" fairly sure WFC isn't good for $85 million, nor do we have a spare $85 million hiding in our couch cushions here in SE Alaska, so I'd like to say: Now is an excellent opportunity for Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Department of Fish and Game Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang to show in word and deed that $85 million in lost revenue for SE Alaska is unacceptable and will be fought for with every resource available. We need you. Now is the time to show your true colors with vigorous support and focused action. We're all in this boat together, whether we like it or not. ߦ David Richey is a Seafood Producers Cooperative Board Member and a commercial troller based in Sitka since 2008. columns, my turns and letters to the editor represent the view of the author, not the view of the juneau empire. have something to say? here's how to submit a my turn or letter.

60,"Lolita the Orca, could return to Puget Sound in Washington after spending decades in captivity If she is moved, she will be moved to a larger enclosure filled with fresh, deep water to help her rehabilitate Critics are certain moving the 56-year-old whale would be a death sentence An orca that has been living in a Miami aquarium for 50 years could be returned to the Pacific Ocean after Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay took pity on her.  Lolita the Orca, who is also known as Tokitae, was captured off the coast of Washington in 1970. She has lived most of her life inside the Miami Seaquarium, but that could now be set to change.  The Seaquarium, nonprofit Friends of Lolita, and Irsay announced at a press conference on Tuesday that they are hoping to get Lolita moved back to her native waters.  'I think that she'll be very happy to be back and it will be therapeutic for her contrary to the misconception that it will be stressful,' Howard Garrett of Orca Network told KOMO News.  The orca will not just be dumped in the Pacific to fend for herself, but rather be initially placed in a larger enclosure off Orcas Island that will have clean, deep water where she'll be able to hear other orcas in the area.  'My guess is when she hears them. She will answer right away, so she'll call right back,' Garrett, who has been fighting for Lolita to return to Puget Sound since the 1980s, said. 'This is going to be so exciting when she comes back.'  Past proposals have required NOAA to sign off on moving Lolita across the country, however, it is unclear if the agency has. It is also unclear how the animal would be transported back to the Pacific.  Washington's Lummi Nation, a Native American tribe, traveled to Miami in 2018 to leave a nearly 4,000lb totem pole behind as part of an effort to bring the orca back to Washington. It's part of an $8.5million effort to bring Lolita home, according to CBC.  Jewell James, a member of the tribe, accused the Seaquarium of abandoning the animal's needs for money, forcing her to perform for audiences a couple of times a day and said keeping her in the 20-foot tank was like keeping her in a prison cell.  'She's our relative and we want her back,' he said.  However, a British Colombian mammal expert isn't so sure the best move for Lolita is to remove her from the aquarium. 'I think this could be a very cruel and inhumane thing to do,' Director of the University of BC's Marine Mammal Research Unit, Andrew Trites, told CBC. 'Lolita is not a young whale. 'She is a senior citizen and I really worry about...the ethics. She's had constant companionship with people, with white-sided dolphins and she's not adapted to come out here.'  However, the Seaquarium said it has no plans to release the whale, who worked for more than 20 years, due to her age and the possibility that she could be exposed to deadly pathogens and diseases.  Lolita is the oldest whale in captivity at age 56. On average, those in captivity only live until around 45 years old. Wild orcas can live up to 80.  She stop performing last year after falling ill. 'Really they should be ashamed of themselves, they don't care about Lolita, they don't care about her best interests, they don't really care whether she lives or dies,' Robert Rose, who works at Seaquarium, accused the Lummi Nation.  In the early 200s, a whale named Keiko was released back to the ocean, but died a year later after it did not re-assimilate with other whales, even after rehabilitating to its natural habitat.  Capturing orcas was legal in the 1970s, but after a series of protests over hunters working to capture orcas from their mothers, Washington banned the practice.

61,"More than 50 years after the orca known as Lolita was captured for public display, plans are in place to return her from the Miami Seaquarium to her home waters in the Pacific Northwest, where a nearly century-old, endangered killer whale believed to be her mother still swims. An unlikely coalition involving the theme park's owner, an animal rights group and an NFL owner-philanthropist announced the agreement. ""I'm excited to be a part of Lolita's journey to freedom,"" Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said at a news conference Thursday. ""I know Lolita wants to get to free waters."" Lolita, also known as Tokitae, was about 4 years old when she was captured in Puget Sound in summer 1970, during a time of deadly orca roundups. She spent decades performing for paying crowds before falling ill. Last year the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer stage shows with her, under an agreement with federal regulators. Lolita, now 57 years old and 5,000 pounds, lives in a tank that measures 80 feet by 35 feet and is 20 feet deep. The orca believed to be her mother, called Ocean Sun, continues to swim free with other members of their clan and is estimated to be more than 90 years old. That has given advocates of her release optimism that Tokitae could still have a long life in the wild. ""It's a step toward restoring our natural environment, fixing what we've messed up with exploitation and development,"" said Howard Garrett, president of the board of the advocacy group Orca Network, based on Washington state's Whidbey Island. ""I think she'll be excited and relieved to be home -- it's her old neighborhood."" The agreement -- among Irsay; Eduardo Albor, who heads Dolphin Co., which owns the Seaquarium; and the Florida nonprofit Friends of Toki -- still faces hurdles to gaining government approval. The time frame for moving the animal could be 18 to 24 months away, the group said, and the cost could reach $20 million. The plan is to transport Lolita by plane to an ocean sanctuary in the waters between Washington and Canada, where she will initially swim inside a large net while trainers and veterinarians teach her how to catch fish. She will also have to build up her muscles, as orcas typically swim about 100 miles per day, said Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Nation in Washington who also serves on the board of Friends of Toki. ""She was 4 when she was taken, so she was learning to hunt. She knows her family song,"" Morris said. ""She'll remember, but it will take time."" The orca would be under 24-hour care until she acclimates to her new surroundings. Caretakers at the Seaquarium are already preparing her for the journey, officials said. Dolphin Co. took ownership of the Seaquarium in 2021. It operates some 27 other parks and habitats in Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Italy. The legacy of the whale roundups of the 1960s and '70s continues to haunt a distinct group of endangered, salmon-eating orcas that are known as the southern resident killer whales and spend much of their time in the waters between Washington and Canada. At least 13 orcas died in the roundups and 45 were delivered to theme parks around the world, reducing the Puget Sound resident population by about 40% and helping cause problems with inbreeding. Today only 73 remain in the southern resident population, which comprises three familial groups called pods, according to the Center for Whale Research. That's just two more animals than in 1971. Animal rights advocates, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, have long fought for Tokitae to spend her final years back home in a controlled setting. PETA says it doesn't want Lolita to suffer the same fate as her partner Hugo, who died in 1980 from a brain aneurysm after ramming his head repeatedly into the tank's walls. The Seaquarium opened in 1955 on Virginia Key east of downtown Miami. It features a variety of creatures including dolphins, sea lions, manatees, reef fish and sharks, and was the filming location for 88 episodes of the ""Flipper"" TV series as well as movies in the 1960s.

62,"Oct 02, 2019( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex) Filmmaker Jean-Marc Valle set an ambitious goal after visiting the Orcas Island Film Festival for the first time four years ago: He wants to go back every year. The director and producer of 'Dallas Buyers Club,' 'Wild' and the first season of HBO's 'Big Little Lies' thinks the laid-back festival on the biggest of the San Juan Islands is a 'jewel.' It's a little piece of cinephile heaven in the middle of Puget Sound that's captured his heart, imagination and a permanent spot on his calendar. 'It's a moment where now I just can't wait for it,' the French Canadian producer and director said.  'The community, you know, the place has a little David Lynch quality without the weirdness and the danger, something amazing. It's almost like the tulips are moving to some songs, like in 'Blue Velvet.' There's something so great about it. So beautiful.' Entering its sixth year in Eastsound, the festival is quickly gaining a reputation in the filmmaking community. This year's lineup, unspooling Oct. 10-14 at the Orcas Island Center for Performing Arts and Sea View Theatre, rivals most festival offerings. The setting is exotic. And with a festival pass price of $200 for more than three dozen films, it's cheaper than your local cineplex (though the commute's a bit of a bear). How did this remote island up in the San Juans get such high-caliber, awards-season fare for its film festival? The reasons are pretty simple. It starts with location, location, location, said producer Marc Turtletaub, another early festival adopter and island resident. And it's also about curation. 'It's a delight,' Turtletaub said. 'Orcas Island is a delightful place. So the environment is incredible. And they've sort of got this little bit of magic about it, I think, in terms of programming. It's one of the handful of best festivals in the country.' AdvertisingThat delightful location comes thanks to the support of a local tourism grant and community business people and boosters like co-founders Jared Lovejoy and Donna Laslo, who bought into the vision from the start. And that programming magic comes from Carl Spence, a West Seattle resident who has spent decades programming festivals for movie fans. The former festival director and chief curator at the Seattle International Film Festival, where he was involved for more than 20 years, Spence is the co-founder and chief curator of the Orcas Island event. He's also a senior programmer with the Miami Film Festival. He spends a large chunk of each year flying around the globe in pursuit of the best films he can find. 'Relationships, we're in the relationship business,' Spence said. 'There's a lot of people that I've known who when I first started, they were just junior acquisitions people. Now, some of those same people are running many of the companies that are providing us with films.' Another big draw is the growing number of executives and celebrities moving to the islands: 'It doesn't hurt that Oprah just bought a place.' Thanks to Spence's curatorial prowess, though, it has caught the attention of film fans outside the islands. More than 5,000 attended last year's festival, arriving by ferry, seaplane and four-seater prop planes. While there's a crush of celebrity paparazzi in Cannes chasing starlets and a continent's worth of film writers in Toronto seeking industry news, most of the folks who attend Orcas Island remain focused on artistry and storytelling. Advertising'This is the moment of the year where I become a cinephile again,' Valle said. 'You can watch two or three films a day in a dark room with a crowd, and the selection is just amazing. So this is why I'm doing this. My job is a director making films. And I love to be in a dark room and just to watch films. And I have less and less occasion to do that since I've been so busy. So I take the time to go there, enjoy some rest andmainly enjoy some films for four or five days.' He'll have a terrible time choosing what to watch this year. Spence traveled to Cannes, Toronto and Telluride, among others, while chasing this year's lineup[1]. It includes top entries from Cannes— including Palme d'Or winner 'Parasite,' a dark comedy thriller from Bong Joon-ho, Ladj Ly's 'Les Misrables' and Mati Diop's 'Atlantics ' — as well as the drama 'Synonyms,' the Golden Bear winner at the Berlin Film Festival. There's the provocative satire 'JoJo Rabbit,' the Audience Award winner from Toronto featuring Taika Waititi as Adolf Hitler. Alfre Woodard dazzles yet again in Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner 'Clemency.' And Antonio Banderas meditates on the life of an aging filmmaker in 'Pain and Glory,' from aging filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar.Spence talks lovingly about the lineup, slipping seamlessly from title to title in a dreamy stream-of-consciousness riff that goes on for more than 15 minutes. 'That's probably more than you need to know,' he said with a self-deprecating laugh. Even so, there's more. There are eight international Academy Award submissions as well as a few films that will hit very close to home in the Pacific Northwest. Those include 'The Edge of the Knife,' spoken entirely in the endangered language of the Haida people of the Canadian and Alaska coasts. And 'Artifishal,' a documentary that tracks the decline of wild salmon runs.And in what is becoming something of an annual occurrence, Valle will conduct a master class of sorts around the documentary 'Big Giant Wave.' Valle serves as executive producer on director Marie-Julie Dallaire's documentary about the effect music has on humans. Last year, he spent time breaking down the editing on an episode of 'Sharp Objects,' the HBO series he directed, for a few hundred attendees. 'And it was fascinating,' said Turtletaub, whose 'The Farewell,' which he co-produced, will screen at the festival. 'So you have those sorts of things happening, which are sort of outside the norm of just, 'OK, here's the latest film that people are talking about.' And then there's the music. I'm sure Jean-Marc will probably DJ this year. We'll twist his arm a bit.' _____ The Orcas Island Film Festival, runs Thursday, Oct. 10, through Monday, Oct. 14, at the Orcas Island Center for Performing Arts, 917 Mount Baker Road, and Sea View Theatre, 234 A St., Eastsound; $25 per screening, $200-$500 for a festival pass; orcasfilmfest.com[2] Chris Talbott is a Seattle-based writer and editor.

63,"MOUNT VERNON - Endangered southern resident orcas from J pod were seen last week in Puget Sound. Initially the dense fog in the area made it difficult Oct. 4 for Orca Network Whale Sighting Network staff to confirm the number and type of whales. Orca Whale Sightings Network Coordinator Alisa Lemire Brooks said she met the whales near Shilshole Bay Marina in Seattle to get a clear count and confirmed they were members of J pod. Up to seven were seen together, but Lemire Brooks was able to see whales spanning up to two miles, which meant it was likely all of J pod. ""It's always a gift to say hello in person to familiar orcas as they travel this urban part of their home range in search of food they are dependent upon,"" Lemire Brooks said. Southern resident orcas move into Puget Sound during the fall and early winter months to follow the winter salmon runs. The salmon, mainly chinook, make up 80 percent of their diet. During the warmer months, the pod travels throughout the Salish Sea, visiting Puget Sound, the San Juan Islands and Georgia Strait. J pod swam as far south as Bainbridge Island before heading north and staying in Puget Sound overnight. On Wednesday, the pod made its way up to Admiralty Inlet and early on Thursday was seen west of San Juan Island. J pod is one of three southern resident pods found in the area. A census done July 1 by the Center of Whale Research counted 73 orcas between J, K and L pods. In 2021 there were 74 whales in the three pods. For the next few months, whale watchers can see J, K and L pods from Whidbey Island, the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas, the inland shore of Puget Sound and while on ferries. The public is asked to send whale sightings to sightings@orcanetwork.org, message the Orca Network Facebook page, call 360-331-3543 or visit the Orca Network website. ""The anticipation in the local community this time of year is palpable,"" Lemire Brooks said in a news release.

64,"A recently published biological opinion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) finds that aquaculture operations in Washington States Puget Sound have no adverse impact on salmon, orcas or other native species in that ecosystem. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service has released a biological opinion regarding marine finfish aquaculture in Puget Sound, finding little to no negative impact on native species such as endangered salmon, orcas or their habitat. The NOAA analysis was initiated in October of 2018 to analyse the effects of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of the Washington Department of Ecology's Sediment Management Standards regarding marine finfish rearing facilities. In its analysis, NOAA found that EPA's approval: Is ""not likely to jeopardise the continued existence"" of Puget Sound (PS) and/or Georgia Basin (GB) species, including Chinook salmon, PS steelhead, Hood Canal summer-run chum, PS/GB yelloweye rockfish or PS/GB bocaccio. Is ""not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the designated critical habitats for any of the listed species."" In response to this opinion, the Northwest Aquaculture Alliance (NWAA) is calling on regulators and policymakers to follow the science in making key decisions regarding marine aquaculture in Washington waters. ""After years of meticulous research and study, the scientists at NOAA have concluded, with full scientific certainty, that net-pen aquaculture in Puget Sound is safe for the environment and safe for the endangered species that live in these waters,"" said Jim Parsons, NWAA President. Parsons is also CEO of Jamestown Seafood. ""This study, along with the recent unanimous Washington Supreme Court decision upholding Cooke Aquaculture Pacific's permit to raise native steelhead in Puget Sound, finally puts to rest one of the biggest myths of all: that fish farming has a negative impact on endangered Chinook salmon and Orcas,"" Parsons said. ""As aquatic farmers, we depend on a healthy ecosystem to grow a range of aquatic food products-from steelhead trout to black cod to oysters, clams, mussels and sea vegetables instead of importing these foods. Sustainable aquaculture not only produces the nutritious, affordable food our world needs, but it also benefits working families in our rural communities."" Parsons added: ""Given the current world situation, it's time for Washington to lead the way in delivering fresh, locally produced, seafood to consumers throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. We encourage our leaders to rely on science rather than politics or claims made by certain anti-aquaculture activist groups in making key decisions about the future of aquatic farming and the Blue Economy in Washington.""

65,"Dec 01, 2018( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex) Orcas were back in the central Puget Sound again Friday, thrilling onlookers at Alki Point. The whales are here likely foraging on chum and coho and resident chinook salmon, said Brad Hanson, biologist with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. It's been unusual to see the orcas so frequently, including two weeks in November[1] when the whales wowed ferry riders and residents all over the region.Friday's arrival was right on time with the whales' more typical pattern.  The southern residents often visit Seattle's inland sea in December.It is J pod that most frequently visits the inland waters of Puget Sound in December but K pod was putting on the show Friday. [Hostile Waters: Orcas thrive in a land to the north. Why are Puget Sound's dying?[2]]For writer and photographer Trileigh Tucker of NaturalPresenceArts.com[3] the thrills started at 1:30 p.m. when she got word from a friend the whales were just offshore of Tucker's home in West Seattle. A quick dash to Me-Kwa-Mooks Park in West Seattle brought the first sight of dorsals, and even the sweet moment of watching the orcas rest, all in a line, breathing sequentially, one whale, then another, Tucker said. It was the delight on people's faces as she walked toward her car, preparing to leave, that alerted her she needed to turn around — just in time to see the giant leaps the orcas were making. Such a show that she took about 300 pictures in all, running from Constellation Park to Alki to follow the whales. She shared the photos on Flickr[4]. It seemed like the orcas just all of a sudden decided to start breaching and tail slapping, Tucker said. 'The humans were so excited and the whales seemed to be, too.'The orcas' preference for chinook in their diet in summer is well known, when the largest, fattiest salmon of them all makes up more than 90 percent of their diet. But with the arrival of fall and winter, the orcas shift their diet to other species, including coho and steelhead, in addition to chum and resident chinook, also called blackmouth, which the southern residents will chase all the way into central Puget Sound. Critically endangered, there are only 74 southern resident orcas left in the J, K and L pods. There's no way to tell how long the whales will stick around. But their fans are waiting: an orca parade at noon is a highlight of festivities Saturday at Alki Beach Bathhouse, 2701 Alki Ave. SW., from 10 to 2 p.m.sponsored by the Seal Sitters[5] and the Whale Trail[6], and other environmental nonprofits and the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Also on the agenda is a lecture Dec. 4 featuring researchers from UW Superfund Research group.

66,"SEATTLE - A large pod of orcas swam around a Washington state ferry that was carrying tribal artifacts to a new museum at the ancestral home of Chief Seattle, and some people think it was more than a coincidence. Killer whales have been thrilling whale watchers this week in Puget Sound, according to the Orca Network, which tracks sightings. But they were especially exciting Tuesday when nearly three-dozen orcas surrounded the ferry from Seattle as it approached the terminal on Bainbridge Island. On board were officials from The Burke Museum in Seattle who were moving ancient artifacts to the Suquamish Museum. The artifacts were dug up nearly 60 years ago from the site of the Old Man House, the winter village for the Suquamish tribe and home of Chief Sealth, also known as Chief Seattle. The Burke, a natural history museum on the University of Washington campus, is known for Northwest Coast and Alaska Native art. Also on board the state ferry was Suquamish Tribal Chairman Leonard Forsman who happened to be returning from an unrelated event. As the ferry slowed near the terminal, it was surrounded by the orcas, Forsman said Wednesday. ""They were pretty happily splashing around, flipping their tails in the water,"" he said. ""We believe they were welcoming the artifacts home as they made their way back from Seattle, back to the reservation."" The killer whales have been in Puget Sound feeding on a large run of chum salmon, he said. ""We believe the orcas took a little break from their fishing to swim by the ferry, to basically put a blessing on what we were on that day,"" he said. Forsman believes there's a spiritual tie between the tribe and the orcas. ""They are fishermen like we are,"" he said. It was an auspicious arrival for about 500 artifacts that The Burke Museum had held for nearly 60 years, Suquamish Museum Director Janet Smoak said. They include tools, decorative items and bits of bone and rock that date back 2,000 years. The Old Man House - the largest known longhouse on the Salish Sea - was located at Suquamish on the shore of Agate Passage, about 13 miles northwest of Seattle. Chief Sealth, for whom Seattle is named, is buried there. The longhouse was burned down by the U.S. government in the late 1800s. The artifacts were collected by a University of Washington archaeological investigation in the 1950s, according to the Burke museum. In 2012, the tribe completed its new museum, which includes a climate controlled environment. The artifacts will be displayed to illustrate Suquamish culture in an exhibit called Ancient Shores Changing Tides. Everyone was talking about the orcas at the Tuesday museum blessing ceremony and feast, Smoak said. ""Everyone was really excited and moved by the event,"" she said. The orcas, identified from their markings as members of the J and K pods, were seen this week along several routes between the Seattle area and the west side of Puget Sound, according to Howard Garrett of the Orca Network at Freeland. He thought their intersection with the ferry carrying tribal artifacts was uncanny. ""I can't rule out somehow they could pick up on the mental energy that there is something special there. Or it could be a coincidence,"" he said. ""I don't know."" AP photo A pair of orca whales swim in view of a state ferry crossing from Bainbridge Island toward Seattle in Puget Sound, Tuesday, as seen some miles away from Seattle.

67,"SEATTLE _ Puget Sound killer whales appear to be more contaminated than northern orcas because they're eating salmon that is more toxic, a new study suggests. Researchers measuring the presence of toxic chemicals in chinook salmon, a prime food for the whales, found higher levels in salmon from Puget Sound than from British Columbia waters. Canadian and Washington scientists also found chinook from Puget Sound had lower fat content and were less nutritious than salmon tested farther north. The scientists think the lower fat content could cause Puget Sound orcas to eat 50 per cent more salmon, resulting in more toxic exposure. ''It was an exploration to look at why southern residents might be more contaminated than northern residents,'' said Sandra O'Neill, an author and research scientist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. ''We have to consider not only how contaminated the fish are but the quality of the fish in terms of lipids and size as a food supply to whales.'' Unlike other killer whales, both ''northern resident'' and ''southern resident'' orcas eat fish rather than mammals. The southern orcas frequent Puget Sound for most of the year, while the northern residents typically ply the waters of the Johnstone Strait area and northern British Columbia. The endangered Puget Sound orcas now number 83 after seven vanished last year. Lack of food, pollution and noise from vessels are believed to be their biggest threats. ''The results here are pretty much what we expected, and they hammer home the point that it's urgent we do something,'' said David Bain, a Seattle-area marine biologist who has done research on the orcas but wasn't involved in this study. ''Salmon are getting a lot dirtier and making it harder for southern residents,'' he said. Researchers measured the presence of persistent organic pollutants in adult chinook and smolts, including polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and the pesticide DDT, which persist in the environment, despite being banned since the 1970s. O'Neill cautioned the study was based on a very small sample from two chinook populations in Puget Sound and southern residents feed on many populations. Researchers tested six adult chinook taken from the mouth of the Duwamish River in Seattle and six from the Tumwater Falls Hatchery on the Deschutes River near Olympia. They tested six adult salmon from Johnstone Strait and the same number from the mouth of the Fraser River in British Columbia. They estimate adult salmon accumulate most of their contaminants while at sea. The Puget Sound fish had higher concentrations of contaminants and lower fat content, the study found. ''It's one more building block for us in terms of understanding where these sources are'' of contaminants, said Brad Hanson, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. He is doing separate research on what specific runs of fish orcas eat. The study was published in the January issue of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. It was written by Donna Cullen, a doctoral student at the University of Victoria with Peter Ross, a research scientist with Canada Fisheries, as the supervising author.

The decision came in response to a petition by Pacific Legal Foundation, a property-rights group, based on a scientifically invalid argument that the Sound's ""southern resident"" killer whales are not a distinct population. The federal government conducted a year-long review of the status and eligibility of the orcas for Endangered Species Act protection and confirmed that the whale's endangered listing remains warranted. ""It's a huge relief that orcas will stay protected.

Today's decision rejected the Pacific Legal Foundation's arguments that Puget Sound's orca population does not quality for Endangered Species Act protection; instead the Fisheries Service affirmed that this population is unique, with new science confirming that Puget Sound's orcas are distinct and deserve protection. The Fisheries Service also concluded that threats to the survival of the killer whales continue and they need to retain their endangered status. ""Killer whales are a symbol of the wild and beautiful Pacific Northwest. Protecting these orcas is protecting our natural heritage, and it's hard to understand why anyone would want to take away their safety net and make them vulnerable to extinction,"" said Sakashita. In response to a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity and allies, southern resident orcas were protected as endangered in 2005 based on numerous factors making their population distinct. Unlike some orca populations, southern residents feed extensively on salmon; they have a unique dialect; and they are genetically unique. The orcas are severely threatened by pollution, past overcollection by the aquarium industry, and habitat destruction, which also threatens the salmon that make up the orcas' diet.

70," SEATTLE -- In a victory for environmentalists, the federal government listed Puget Sound's killer whales as an endangered species Tuesday, giving the animals the highest protection available under the law. The three pods of orcas that live in Puget Sound from late spring through early fall total 89 whales -- down from more than 100 in the middle of the last century but up from a low of 79 in 2002. Their decline has been blamed on pollution and a drop in the population of salmon, their primary food. ""Endangered"" means a species is in danger of becoming extinct. That is a higher level of protection than the government proposed last year, when it said the orcas should be listed as a ""threatened"" species. ""Between the time we proposed to list these animals as threatened and now, we've discovered the population is in a more delicate situation than we had assumed,"" said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service. Previously, the three pods were protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which kept them from being killed or harassed. The new listing under the Endangered Species Act will require federal agencies to make sure their activities do not harm the marine mammals and to give them better protection against pollution and a loss of salmon. Eight environmental groups sued in 2002 over the government's refusal to list the whales under the Endangered Species Act. The government maintained it could not do that because the Puget Sound orcas were not biologically distinct from other orcas. The environmental groups argued that the Puget Sound orcas have a distinctive call and a different diet and features from other orcas, do not mate outside their family structure, and show an attachment to one geographic region. A federal judge ordered the fisheries service to reconsider. Patti Goldman, an attorney with Earthjustice in Seattle, said endangered status might help environmentalists win more money from the government to protect the orcas. ""This will give us the will and the tools to take the actions that will allow them to survive,"" Goldman said. Kathy Fletcher of the environmental group People for Puget Sound said the new listing could also help speed the cleanup of contamination in the sound.

71,"Puget Sound's endangered killer whales have been spotted with a new calf, bringing the number of orcas to 86 as the whales feed on salmon along the California coast, scientists said. Researchers don't yet know if the baby is a male or female, but have identified it as belonging to one of three whale family groups, or pods, that make their permanent home around Puget Sound. The whales were seen over the weekend in Monterey Bay, Calif. Scientists with the Center for Whale Research, based on San Juan Island, said photos of the whales' unique markings show the baby belongs to the ""L"" pod of Puget Sound orcas. The orcas typically spend about six months near the San Juan Islands and in Puget Sound. They're expected to return in May or June. The center said killer whales from Washington have increasingly been seen off the coast of California in recent winters, likely searching for salmon to eat. Researchers said the latest sightings suggest the orcas from the ""L"" and ""K"" pods have been near California for most of the winter. ""I'm delighted that they'll go where food is available,"" Ken Balcomb, the center's senior scientist, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""They're not going to sit here and starve and wash up on our shores."" The third Puget Sound group, known as the ""J"" pod, recently was seen in Haro Strait, closer to its home range. Researchers said the baby was born between late October and early 2007 to one of two female orcas. If its mother is the younger of those two, the baby could have a harder time surviving because it likely would be the female's first calf. Industrial chemicals that accumulate in the orcas' bodies can be concentrated in fatty tissue and milk; new mothers can pass those pollutants on to their first and second calves, Balcomb said. If the baby survives to return to the Northwest this summer, ""that's a very good start,"" said Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, a whale center research associate. ""Then it will have the summer to relax in the nice San Juan Islands and feed on fish,"" Balcomb-Bartok said. The Puget Sound-based orca population had dropped to 85 last fall, following the death of three adults and two calves.

72,"In a victory for environmentalists, the federal government listed Puget Sound's killer whales as an endangered species Tuesday, giving the animals the highest protection available under the law. The three pods of orcas that live in Puget Sound from late spring through early fall total 89 whales - down from more than 100 in the middle of the last century but up from a low of 79 in 2002. Their decline has been blamed on pollution and a drop in the population of salmon, their primary food. ""Endangered"" means a species is in danger of becoming extinct. That is a higher level of protection than the government proposed last year, when it said the orcas should be listed as a ""threatened"" species. ""Between the time we proposed to list these animals as threatened and now, we've discovered the population is in a more delicate situation than we had assumed,"" said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service. Previously, the three pods were protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which kept them from being killed or harassed. The new listing under the Endangered Species Act will require federal agencies to make sure their activities do not harm the marine mammals and to give them better protection against pollution and a loss of salmon. Eight environmental groups sued in 2002 over the government's refusal to list the whales under the Endangered Species Act. The government maintained it could not do that because the Puget Sound orcas were not biologically distinct from other orcas. The environmental groups argued that the Puget Sound orcas have a distinctive call and a different diet and features from other orcas, do not mate outside their family structure, and show an attachment to one geographic region. A federal judge ordered the fisheries service to reconsider. Patti Goldman, an attorney with Earthjustice in Seattle, said endangered status might help environmentalists win more money from the government to protect the orcas. ""This will give us the will and the tools to take the actions that will allow them to survive,"" Goldman said. Kathy Fletcher of the environmental group People for Puget Sound said the new listing could also help speed the cleanup of contamination in the sound.

73,"SEATTLE - Killer whales that spend their summers in Puget Sound are a distinct population group and will remain protected under the Endangered Species Act, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Friday. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service spent a year reviewing a petition to delist the orcas. The petition was brought by the Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of California farmers who faced water restrictions to protect salmon the orcas eat. They argued the Puget Sound orcas were part of a larger north Pacific population and didn't qualify for the 2005 endangered species listing. But NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman said those arguments were rejected. ""We have decided these killer whales are a distinct population group,"" Gorman said. ""They have their own language, own food source. They don't interbreed with other groups of killer whales. They meet the legal standard for a distinct population group."" He added officials are continuing to work on recovery plan options. There are now 82 orcas in three pods - J, K and L - which also spend much of the year in the Pacific off the West Coast. ""It's great news that Puget Sound's orcas will continue to be protected,"" said Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director for the Center for Biological Diversity in San Francisco. ""It was troubling to even think that the killer whales might have their protections stripped,"" she said in an email. Despite their popularity with whale watchers and symbolic value to the region, the orcas are ""not in the best of shape,"" Gorman said. Their numbers peaked at close to 100 in the 1990s. ""Water quality in Puget Sound isn't the best. There's lots of boat traffic, especially in the summer,"" Gorman said. ""Their food - Chinook salmon are limited. And that's just in Puget Sound. We have no idea what goes on in the ocean where they spend most of their time."" A recovery plan issued in 2008 suggests actions to address threats from pollution, vessel traffic and noise and a limited food supply, NOAA said in a news release.

74,"Large ships in the Puget Sound are voluntarily slowing down to lessen the negative impact underwater sound can have on endangered killer whales. The slowdown trial, taking place from Oct. 24 to Dec. 22, is led by Quiet Sound, a part of Maritime Blue, an organization that is dedicated to making the maritime industry more sustainable and equitable. The slowdown is an attempt to better the lives of southern resident killer whales, a distinct population of orcas that spend several months of the year in Puget Sound. These whales are a critically endangered species. There are currently only 73 of them; it is estimated that a stable population would be about 150 to 200 whales. ""This is the time of year when the whales tend to come south of Admiralty Inlet into Puget Sound, so we're asking vessels in the shipping lanes to slow down between Admiralty Inlet and Edmonds,"" said Rachel Aronson, program director for Quiet Sound. ""It's about 20 nautical miles of what we're hoping is improved foraging habitat for them."" Those piloting the vessels are asked to slow down by 30 to 50% which has proven to reduce underwater noise by about 50%, a significant amount. Aronson explained that the southern residents eat fish like Chinook salmon, also an endangered species. Another reason their numbers are so low is that in the 1960s and 1970s, orcas were being captured and taken to aquariums. The population was never able to fully recover. Quiet Sound was created as part of Gov. Jay Inslee's orca recovery task force, a response to the declining number of orcas. The task force consisted of scientists who knew the most about the southern residents and they identified three major threat categories: prey availability (the number of fish in the water), toxins in the water and vessel noise, vessel strike (collision between a boat and marine animal) and simply the presence of vessels close to whales. ""There's a decent amount of science showing that when vessels are just too close to a whale, they stop hunting and they get kind of uncomfortable having their habitat infringed on,"" Aronson said. Vessel noise affects orcas because they use echolocation to find the fish they eat. The noise from boat propellers is in the same frequency orcas use to hunt and communicate. ""When a vessel slows down, it actually reduces the underwater noise of the vessel by quite a lot and it lessens the impact of the vessel by quite a lot,"" Aronson said. She said even recreational vessels can have a negative impact but Quiet Sounds is focusing on commercial vessels. This includes ferries, cargo and carrier ships, vehicle carriers, bulkers, tankers and tug boats. ""Basically, if it's a big commercial vessel, we are trying to help them be safer around whales,"" Aronson said. Quiet Sound was modeled after the Canadian ECHO program, which has been doing slowdowns for six to eight years for whales off the coast of British Columbia. Aronson said it is difficult for humans to hear the underwater noise. For that reason, Quiet Sound is putting a microphone underwater to capture both before and after the slowdown to see if it makes a difference. She said the response to the initiative so far has been positive. ""We worked with the shipping industry from the very beginning to design the slowdown so that it was something that is feasible, accurate to the realities of what it's like to be steering these very, very large ships that take 5 miles to slow down,"" she said. A couple shippers have already committed to participating, including Maersk, the second biggest shipping company in the world, as well as Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Nissan Motor Car Carrier. Puget Sound pilots, which are at the helm of every large vessel that travels through the inlet, are participating. ""We'll have an advocate on board every vessel,"" Aronson said. It would be up to the state legislature to decide if the slowdown will become mandatory in the future ""One of the nice things about the voluntary approach is that we can move faster than the regulatory process,"" she said. Pilots have access to the WhaleReport Alert System, an app for commercial pilots that alerts them when a whale has been spotted within 10 nautical miles. Aronson said if members of the public want to support this effort, they can report any whale sighting through this app and another called Whale Alert. This provides real-time information about where whales are. Quiet Sound will be hosting a press event on Dec. 9 to review the effects of the trial and share next steps. Inslee will be in attendance.

75,"The waters of Puget Sound in the vicinity of West Seattle and Vashon were graced by a superpod of Southern Resident killer whales from Nov. 7 to 10 — an occasion for both reverence and concern to those celebrating their return. This summer, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) designated 12 critically endangered SSRKW as vulnerable and at a substantially increased risk of premature death because they are in alarmingly poor body condition. The malnourished orcas are pregnant Moonlight (L83) and her adolescent son Midnight (L110); female calf Tofino (J56); matriarch Ino (L54); adult female Alki (J36); adult female Calypso (L94); adult female Ballena (L90) — lone survivor of her matriline; adult male Blackberry (J27); adolescent male Moby (J44); juvenile male Tílem Ínges (J49); adolescent male Finn (L116); and adolescent male Keta (L117). Some SRKW look disturbingly thin; some have ""peanut head,"" described as fat loss around an orca's head and behind the blowhole. Moreover, youngsters Kiki (J53) and Lazuli (L123), both seven years old, exhibit stunted growth, and Kiki is in below-average body condition. Matriarch Racer (L72) merits vulnerable status because she is in late-stage pregnancy. The pregnancy failure rate among the SRKW is nearly 70%. Research shows that late-stage pregnancy requires as much as 25% more food in the final month of gestation. Boats and other watercraft, such as kayaks, within 400 yards of SRKW interrupt foraging, often causing females to cease feeding. Because female orcas share prey with their offspring, pregnant and nursing SRKW mothers with young calves are highly sensitive to disruption by vessel noise and presence, which can impede crucial prey capture and sharing. Researchers from Sealife Response, Rehabilitation, and Research (SR3) used measurements from drone photographs obtained between September 2021 and April 2022 to determine body conditions and identify pregnancies among the SRKW. Based on SR3's assessments, WDFW issued an emergency order on June 30, requiring commercial whale-watching boats – and urging all boaters - to maintain a distance of at least one-half nautical mile from endangered SRKW. In addition, mothers with calves receive extra protection via WAC 220-460-110, which prohibits motorized commercial whale-watching vessels from approaching within a one-half nautical mile of any SRKW group that contains a calf less than one-year-old. From Nov. 7 to 10, all of these fragile orcas and more were in the vicinity of West Seattle and Vashon, hunting salmon and socializing in a Southern Resident superpod. All 73 members of J, K, and L Pods were likely present: 25 in J Pod, 16 in K Pod, and 32 in L Pod. The population of 73 is the lowest SRKW population number in 38 years. Diminished prey availability is a major factor in the decline of these orcas. This fall, Chum, Coho and Blackmouth (immature Chinook) salmon are more abundant throughout the north and central Puget Sound areas where the SRKW foraged. During this four-day period, Mark and Maya Sears were the only NOAA-permitted researchers on the water snapping identification photos and collecting fecal, prey, and other samples. They confirmed the presence of all SRKW matrilines (family groups) and babies born in 2022 — J59 and K45, both females. J59's mother is Hy'Shqa (J37), age 21, and K45's mother is Spock (K20), age 36. Mark Sears first spotted Hy'Shqa as a baby in Vashon waters in 2001. He also discovered Spock's first calf, Comet (K38), in Colvos Pass in December 2004. Beloved Blackberry (J27), age 31, appeared skinny when he breached, but he is energetic. On Nov. 9 and 10, part of the superpod ventured into waters off Vashon's northeast side. Several orcas traveled as far south as Tramp Harbor on Nov. 9, where Odin Lonning and I observed them. At least 30 SRKW, some breaching, slowed the ferries and graced the triangle run morning commute on Nov. 10. These SRKW encounters are extraordinary because L Pod has not visited Vashon since January 2020, and superpods are now infrequent. A superpod in the central Sound is quite rare. The last well-documented superpod occurred in September 2018, near Victoria, BC. We celebrate the annual return of our imperiled SRKW to Vashon, and encourage islanders and visitors to embrace personal behavior that promotes recovery of this culturally and spiritually significant orca population. Actively reducing our carbon footprint benefits orcas and their food source, salmon. We tread lightly when we refrain from chasing critically endangered SRKW – in fossil fuel emitting cars, boats and ferries — all over the Salish Sea, and by watching orcas at a shore-based location closest to where we reside.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, issued the following statement on May 17, 2022: * * * Eastern Washington Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05) today grilled Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan for his refusal to address toxic dumping in Puget Sound. Following their exchange in today's Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change hearing, Rodgers released the following statement: ""The federal government has already spent millions of dollars to clean up Puget Sound, yet pollution and toxic conditions in the Sound continue to kill fish. Why? Because Governor Inslee and the Biden administration continue to look the other way while municipalities in King County illegally dump millions of gallons of raw sewage into the Sound. Now, Democrats in power want to throw another $89 million at the problem without actually enforcing the water quality standards on the books. This approach will ensure Puget Sound salmon, and the orcas who rely on them for food, continue on a path to extinction. It's time for this administration and all of us to get serious about saving the Sound."" CMR: ""When you talk about laws being clearly violated, I wanted to draw your attention again to Puget Sound in Washington State. This is critical. This is a critical issue to orcas, to endangered salmon, taxpayer outlays, environmental justice. ""You've said that you're committed to cleaning up Puget Sound, but cleanup will continue to be a constant problem if King County and the state continue to look the other way when there's million of gallons of raw sewage being dumped into Puget Sound every year, endangering salmon runs and polluting the waters. ""If you look at Washington State's latest 'State of Salmon' report, Snake River Fall Chinook are approaching their goal and steelhead are making progress, but the Puget Sound Chinook and Steelhead, those stocks that are most important to the Orca, are in crisis. ""EPA's failure to act is eroding three federal efforts: protecting orcas from extinction, safeguarding the salmon that are essential to orca diets, and promoting salmon populations. ""Will you use your ""backstop"" authority to end this excessive sewage dumping by major municipalities?"" Regan: ""What we've done is ... what I believe to be a very strong job of enforcing the consent order that's on the books ... [and] we're going to continue to work with the state to enforce that consent order. ""One of the good things that I can report is thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, we've got about 89 more million dollars to put towards projects like the Puget Sound, so that we can get the cleanup on the trajectory it needs to be. [...] We can't ignore that there has been progress but not enough progress."" CMR: ""The state continues to issue the permits.

77," A plan announced last week to return Lolita, a killer whale held captive for more than a half-century, to her home waters in Washington's Puget Sound thrilled those who have long advocated for her to be freed from her tank at the Miami Seaquarium.  But it also called to mind the release of Keiko - the star of the movie ""Free Willy"" - more than two decades ago. Keiko's return to his native Iceland improved upon his life in a Mexico City tank, but he failed to adapt to the wild and died five years later.  He is the only orca released after long-term captivity. Some of Lolita's former caregivers are warning she could face a similar fate - or that she might not survive a move across the country.  But advocates say there are big differences between the cases and that their experience with Keiko will inform how they plan for Lolita's return.  While they hope to bring Lolita - also known as Tokitae, or Toki - to a whale sanctuary among the Pacific Northwest's many islands, they know she might never again swim freely with her endangered family, including the nearly century-old whale believed to be her mother.  Here's a look at Tokitae's story.  How did Toki wind up in captivity?  Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest revere orcas, considering them their relatives.  White settlers had a different view. Fishermen reviled the ""blackfish"" as competition for salmon and sometimes shot them.  That began to change in 1965, when a man named Ted Griffin bought a killer whale that had been caught in a fisherman's net in British Columbia and towed it to the Seattle waterfront. The whale - Namu - became a sensation.  Namu soon died from an infection, but Griffin had set off a craze for capturing the Pacific Northwest's killer whales and training them to perform, as The Seattle Times recounted in a 2018 history. Griffin corralled dozens of orcas off Washington's Whidbey Island in 1970. Several got caught and drowned when opponents cut the nets, intending to free them.  Many orcas remained nearby, declining to leave as their clan members were hauled out of the water. Among those kept was four-year-old Tokitae, later sold to the Miami Seaquarium.  By the early 1970s, at least 13 Northwest orcas had been killed and 45 delivered to theme parks around the world; Toki is the only one still alive. The roundups reduced the Puget Sound resident population by about 40 per cent and helped cause problems with inbreeding that imperil them today.  Outrage over the captures helped prompt the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.  Why bring Toki home?  Lolita, now 57, spent decades performing. Last year the Miami Seaquarium announced it would no longer feature her under an agreement with regulators. The 5,000-pound (2,267-kilogram) animal lives in a tank 80 feet by 35 feet (24 metres by 11 metres) and 20 feet (six metres) deep.  Whales are intelligent, social creatures, and activists have long dreamed of returning Tokitae to her family.  The whale believed to be Toki's mother is the matriarch of L-pod, one of three clans that make up the so-called southern resident killer whales, a genetically and socially distinct population that frequents the Salish Sea between Washington and British Columbia. There are 73 southern residents remaining.  Plans call for bringing Lolita to a netted whale sanctuary of about 15 acres (six hectares). She would be released into an enclosure the size of a couple football fields within that sanctuary, where she would be under round-the-clock care.  ""The first objective is to provide her the highest quality of life we can,"" said Charles Vinick, a founder of the non-profit Friends of Toki as well as executive director of the Whale Sanctuary Project. ""Whether or not it becomes the dream of having her reunite with L-pod is something we have to rely on Lolita to show us.""  Because the southern residents are endangered, advocates would have to obtain additional permits if they ever wanted to return Toki fully to the wild. Advocates would likely have to show that introducing another aging whale wouldn't further burden the population, which has struggled with a dearth of salmon.  With financial backing from Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, they have agreed to support Lolita long term, whether she's reintroduced or not.  For Raynell Morris, an elder of the Lummi Indian Tribe in Washington and a board member of Friends of Toki, the whale's return is fundamental.  ""Until she's returned to her family, our family is broken,"" Morris said. ""When she comes home, the web of life will be repaired and restored, and our people will be repaired and restored.""  But a group of some of Lolita's former caregivers called Truth 4 Toki announced an online petition Tuesday to keep her in Florida - perhaps at SeaWorld Orlando, where she can live alongside the two Pacific white-sided dolphins she has lived with for the past 30 years.  They describe her as a geriatric animal in poor health who has had trouble adjusting to changes as slight as introducing different music into her performance routine. They say the stress of the move could kill her, but if it doesn't, she could be susceptible to pollutants in Puget Sound.  ""We tried this once with Keiko, and it was an epic failure,"" said Shanna Simpson, who trained Lolita from 2003-09. ""This is rainbows and fluffy human feelings. It's going to wind up in Toki's death.""   How do you move a whale??  When all the pieces are in place - which could take two years - and Lolita is deemed healthy enough to move, she would be put on a stretcher. She'd be lifted by crane into a tank placed on a truck, and the truck driven to a cargo plane.  She'd be flown to Washington, loaded onto a barge, floated to the sanctuary, and lowered by crane into her new home.  Toki's transportation tank would be filled with fresh water - salt water could ruin the plane in the event of a leak. Her caregivers would protect her skin with ointment.  Advocates will work with Washington's Department of Natural Resources to pick the sanctuary site.  What did we learn from Keiko?  Keiko was about 2 when he was captured in 1979. He spent time in Iceland and Canada before being sold in 1985 to a theme park in Mexico City, where he lived in a tank filled with tap water mixed with salt.  In 1993 he was featured in ""Free Willy,"" prompting a campaign by schoolchildren to get him released. A facility was built at the Oregon Coast Aquarium where the emaciated Keiko could recover before his return to Iceland. Keiko gained about 1,000 pounds (453 kilograms) in his first year in Oregon.  Vinick, who helped manage Keiko's return, noted it was always designed as a reintroduction effort. Keiko was in his early 20s - still young for an orca - when he was brought to Iceland in 1998. To teach him to hunt, trainers would launch fish around his pen with a sling shot. Eventually they began escorting him on longer swims in the open ocean.  While Keiko would approach wild orcas at times, he would return to his trainers' boat and generally sought out humans. He swam to Norway on his own - a journey of 1,609 km. But there again he was attracted to boats and people, and he died, apparently of pneumonia, at about age 27.  ""We already knew how easy it is to capture whales,"" Vinick said. ""What we learned with Keiko is how difficult it is to put one back.""

78,"It's heartening to see that Lolita the killer whale will soon be returning to Puget Sound and freedom after spending more than 50 years in captivity. Lolita, a.k.a. Toki, who was a member of the L Pod of southern resident orcas that spend most of their time in the waters off Washington and British Columbia, was captured in 1970 when she was just about four years old, at a time when it was acceptable to take these highly intelligent and sociable beings away from their families, stick them in small swimming pools and force them to perform demeaning tricks for people's entertainment. Fortunately, this practice has come under intense scrutiny and criticism in recent years as humans have slowly come to realize just how cruel it is to these most remarkable creatures, and the aquariums that host orcas around the world have come to their senses (added to the fact that they must be seeing income from people who come to view these performances plummet) with many coming up with plans to have them released back into the wild. Friends of Lolita, a not-for-profit organization, and the Miami Seaquarium where Lolita has lived since 1970 in an 80-by-35-foot concrete tank, have announced they plan to return Lolita to the area in Puget Sound where she was captured within the next 18 to 24 months. But Lolita will face many challenges when she returns to her home. It's been more than 50 years since she last saw her pod and family, and she might not remember them (nor they her) if and when they meet each other again. If that happens and she doesn't reconnect with her family, her freedom may be short lived as it's possible she won't remember the skills to hunt and survive in the open ocean and won't survive long, despite the best efforts of the release team to teach her before letting her loose. But, apparently, it's believed that her mother is still alive (orcas can live up to 90 years in the wild) so I would find it hard to believe that such intelligent mammals would forget their own children, no matter how long they've been away. As well, it's encouraging that Lolita got pretty excited when recorded sounds made by her pod communicating with each other were played for her in her tank at Miami Seaquarium, so it appears she recognizes their voices after all this time. Regardless, no matter how well she does in the wild when she's finally released, I think it's just something that has to be done. Such animals should never live in captivity, and that was made very apparent with the story of Tilikum, the orca that killed three of his trainers over his lifetime. He killed them in separate incidents, including one in Victoria's Sealand of the Pacific, before he tragically died of natural causes in 2017 in a Florida aquarium, miles from his home in the deep blue sea near Greenland where he was captured in 1983. I've no doubt Tilikum remembered where he came from and built up a deep resentment for these two-legged beings that forced him to do stupid tricks and, in between these performances, kept him locked up in tiny pools where he could barely move around. Tilikum lived a sad and cruel life and he apparently decided to return the favour to three of his handlers when the opportunities arose. But, in my experience coming across orcas in the wild, they are intelligent, curious and perfectly in tune with their environment, and to have one such as Tilikum become a human killer was an aberration caused by man and captivity. In fact, there is not one documented case of an orca living in the wild killing a person. We live in a part of the world where we're lucky to see these majestic animals in their natural environment right on our doorsteps. Despite their intimidating name, I can say I've never felt frightened or intimated by them in any way when I used to kayak much more than I do these days, and they would sometimes get pretty close to my boat as they curiously checked me out before moving on. Maybe, one day soon, I'll be privileged enough to meet Lolita and her family face to face in the Salish Sea. robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.comLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter Copyright 2023 Cowichan Valley Citizen Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newspaper Subject: MARINE MAMMALS (91%); REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS (90%); WILDLIFE (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); FAMILY (75%); ANIMALS (74%); MAMMALS (71%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (66%); EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (59%) Industry: ZOOS & AQUARIUMS (77%) Geographic: MIAMI, FL, USA (87%); WASHINGTON, USA (88%)"
79,"Judge says feds overlooked impact of harvest on orcas SEATTLE - A federal court ruling this week has thrown into doubt the future of a valuable commercial king salmon fishery in Southeast Alaska, after a conservation group challenged the government's approval of the harvest as a threat to protected fish and the endangered killer whales that eat them. The ruling, issued Monday by U.S. District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle, said NOAA Fisheries violated the Endangered Species Act and other environmental law when it approved the troll fishery. The ruling means the federal agency will have to consider anew the effects of the fishery on orcas and on protected Puget Sound and Columbia River salmon stocks and whether a plan to offset the harvest by releasing more king salmon from hatcheries is sound. It's unclear whether trollers in the $800 million industry will be allowed to continue fishing for kings, also known as chinook, while that happens. The court is expected to begin considering remedies for the agency's legal violations in the next few weeks. ""We applaud Judge Jones' ruling that is finally calling into question decades of unsustainable chinook harvest management in Southeast Alaska and marks a watershed moment for the recovery of southern resident orcas and wild chinook,"" said Emma Helverson, executive director of Wild Fish Conservancy, the group that challenged the approval of the fishery. NOAA Fisheries said Wednesday it is still reviewing the decision. In a written statement, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said it was considering an appeal. ""We have a responsibility to look out for our fisheries and the Southeast coastal communities and families that rely on them,"" said Commissioner Doug Vincent-Lang. Chinook, the largest of the Pacific salmon species, make up the bulk of the diet for endangered orcas in the waters of the Salish Sea between Washington and Canada. Due to causes that include overfishing, dams, development and pollution, king salmon runs in the Northwest are at a small fraction of their historical abundance, and the orcas have suffered in turn, with just 74 whales remaining and scientists warning of extinction. While the endangered southern resident killer whales don't typically venture as far north as Alaska, a huge amount of the chinook salmon caught in the Southeast Alaska troll fishery - about 97 percent - originate from rivers to the south, in British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. If those fish weren't caught, many would be available for the orcas to eat as the salmon migrate to their natal rivers to spawn, the Wild Fish Conservancy argues. In 2019, NOAA Fisheries issued a biological opinion approving the most recent decadelong plan for the commercial troll fishery for chinook in Southeast Alaska, with harvest limits set during negotiations between the U.S. and Canada. The agency acknowledged the harvest of chinook was likely to hurt the orcas and protected Puget Sound and Columbia River king salmon stocks, but it said it would offset the harm by spending about $100 million on habitat restoration and to increase hatchery production of chinook by 20 million smolts per year, thus providing more food for the whales. Last year, a magistrate judge who reviewed the case, Michelle Petersen, took issue with that, finding that under federal law, NOAA Fisheries could not rely on hypothetical mitigation measures to offset actual harm to protected species. Because the funding for the restoration efforts was uncertain, because there were no binding deadlines for the mitigation measures and because the agency did not actually study what effect an increase of hatchery production would mean for wild salmon stocks or orcas, that mitigation was legally insufficient. Jones adopted her recommendations in his opinion Monday and asked her to consider potential remedies. Possibilities include continuing to allow the trollers to fish for chinook while NOAA fixes the legal errors, banning them from doing so, or something in between. It's also possible NOAA could be ordered to desist from increasing hatchery production of king salmon unless it demonstrates the mitigation plan is sound. Around 1,000 permit-holders fish in the Southeast Alaska commercial troll fishery each year, according to court documents, and the industry supports thousands more full-time jobs. The trolling occurs 10 months out of the year, primarily divided between winter and summer seasons. The fishers also go after coho and chum salmon, but chinook is the most valuable. The Alaska Trollers Association, which intervened as a defendant in the lawsuit, criticized the Wild Fish Conservancy for filing the lawsuit, saying it had no regard for fisheries in Alaska.

80,"Aug 22, 2018( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex) To save more chinook salmon for starving orcas, Seattle chef Renee Erickson has taken it off the menu. Erickson, chef and co-owner of Sea Creatures[1], which includes Seattle restaurants The Walrus and the Carpenter and The Whale Wins, announced her decision recently to her newsletter subscribers and chefs.It's something she has been thinking about for a while. But it was the sight of Tahlequah, the mother orca whale carrying her dead calf for 17 days[2] for more than 1,000 miles that pushed Erickson to no longer serve chinook to her customers.  'It's sad; I love eating it, and I grew up catching it,' Erickson said. But with so many other local fish possibilities, it just felt wrong to take chinook out of orcas' mouths, she said. Most Read Local Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[3]'The biggest gut wrench is that we have starving orcas. We are eating the salmon they need to eat.' Southern resident killer whales, the orcas of the trans-boundary waters of the Salish Sea and West Coast, rely on chinook for more than 90 percent of their diet in the summer. The big, fatty fish are in decline in Puget Sound and the Fraser and Columbia Rivers. That depletes the food supply for orcas in their primary foraging areas. Seeing the impact on the whales, declined to only 75 members in the J, K and L pods, just became too much, Erickson said.She said hers was a decision borne of personal reflection. 'It's nothing heroic,' she said, adding she is not launching a campaign for others to follow suit. Though as a leading, James Beard-award-winning chef, Erickson's influence has been felt before, including her refusal to serve farmed Atlantic salmon at her restaurants. The southern residents face at least three struggles to survive: Too much noise in their home waters makes it harder for them to find food; toxins in their food; and lack of sufficient food add to their trouble. 'To see the effect we are having on these animals, it is too much,' said Erickson. To her, laying off chinook made sense, to leave more for the whales.With so many other good choices, from sockeye in season to local shellfish and coho, 'we live so well,' Erickson said.In an October scientific paper,[4] Rob Williams, a marine-conservation biologist based at Oceans Initiative[5] in Seattle, a nonprofit research firm, found with his co-authors that lack of food was the biggest threat to the southern resident's survival. The whales have to have more food and less racket underwater to be able to hunt, the scientists concluded.Williams, who works with northern and southern resident populations of orca whales, was the lead author on a paper published in PlosOne[6] in November 2011 that found British Columbia salmon stocks in general are estimated to be at 36 percent of historical (1800s) run size, and Puget Sound stocks at 8 percent Because southern resident killer whales specialize in eating chinook, lack of it is linked to increased mortality and reduced reproduction.Prey intake for a lactating female can also be more than 40 percent higher than when not lactating — so for successful reproduction, the southern residents need even more chinook. Instead, runs continue to decline and the southern residents have not successfully reproduced in three years.The southern resident orcas' annual need could be from 211,000 to 364,000 chinook, depending on the body size of the fish, Williams and other authors on the paper determined in their analysis. That's enough to consider managing fish stocks with the whales' consumption in mind, under an ecologically based management scheme — with more fish needed to boost the population to recovery, the scientists found. One clear loser in whale recovery are the chinook themselves — and to recover populations of the fish that are also threatened with extinction, managers need to consider the needs of a recovering orca population — not just human fishermen, according to the scientists. Williams said he thinks Erickson made a good decision.'Chefs across America should think about this,' Williams said. 'If everyone was moved by the sight of J35 and her calf,' he said of Tahlequah, this is one thing you can do: Stop eating chinook.'Don't buy it, don't eat it, don't serve it,' Williams said of chinook. 'The whales need it more than we do.'

81,"Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, issued the following news release: The U.S. House of Representatives voted 350-80 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The legislation, which now heads to the Senate, includes key provisions to preserve and protect crucial Puget Sound habitat -- and the orcas depending on it. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, authored key provisions of the NDAA that would enhance protections for the Puget Sound, including the Marine Mammal Research and Response Act she introduced last year. ""For the first time, this bill establishes a Puget Sound Office where the EPA, NOAA, and other federal partners will have an annual budget for research and recovery efforts to help clean up Puget Sound. The new law will also require the Coast Guard to review and improve oil spill response plans to ensure we are ready in the event of an oil spill or other pollution event. Lastly, our bill requires NOAA and the Coast Guard to work together to protect orcas and other marine life from vessel traffic impacts including noise, pollution, and ship strikes,"" Sen. Cantwell said. Provisions in the NDAA include: * The Puget Sound Save Our Sound Act, which would: - Establish a Puget Sound Recovery National Program office within the Environmental Protection Agency; - Codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of nine federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting the Puget Sound; - Authorize a $50 million annual budget to support Puget Sound recovery under this program. * Provisions to protect Southern resident orcas and marine mammals, including: - A new pilot program to establish a whale desk within the Coast Guard Puget Sound Vessel Traffic Center. The desk would improve coordination between NOAA, the Coast Guard, and the maritime industry to reduce the risk of vessel traffic impacts on Southern resident orcas. This new program, modeled after Canada's Whale Desk, would help track and proactively engage vessel operators to alert them to whale presence, as well as regulations and voluntary guidelines that are in place to protect the whales. - Expansion of near-real time monitoring of large whales to improve management and conservation of endangered species including Northern right whales and orcas. Real time monitoring and the new whale desk will help first responders track and mitigate impacts to orcas from day-to-day vessel traffic and protect them during emergencies, such as the August 2022 oil spill in Friday Harbor. - A $10 million annual competitive grant program to support ports that are proactively working to invest in measures to mitigate vessel impacts and improve conservation of marine mammals. - A $1.5 million annual allocation over five years for NOAA to expand the deployment of ocean noise observation systems for protecting marine life. - A bill introduced by Sen. Cantwell reauthorizing the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue and Response grant program, which provides competitive grants ?marine?mammals that are sick or injured in U.S. waters. Frequent grant recipients include the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Olympia-based Cascadia Research Collective, and the Friday Harbor-based Whale Museum. Funds have previously been used to support the rehabilitation of sick and injured Southern resident orcas, including Springer. ?This legislation would also: - Create a new emergency financial assistance program to help states, Tribes, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations respond to large scale emergency events, including mass stranding or beaching of marine mammals; - Establish a Marine Mammal Health Map to analyze gaps in data to help scientists better understand how marine mammal populations are impacted by climate change and other impacts; - Launch a National Academy of Science study on the connection between ocean warming events, such as harmful algae blooms, and marine mammal mortality.??? * Provisions enhancing oil spill response operations, including: - Increased vessel response plan evaluations and oil spill response drills; - A Coast Guard study on national, regional, and local oil spill response plans and effectiveness; - A requirement that the best available data be used in oil spill preparedness and response. * A provision authored by Sen. Cantwell to secure $800 million for up to six NOAA weather research aircraft for in order to: - Collect important climate and weather related data to help comminutes prepare for and monitor climate change and extreme weather. - This provision would also prioritize research into atmospheric rivers, which are common in Washington state and cause heavy rainfall. - Direct the Maritime Administration to improve the climate resiliency of our nation's ports. * A bill to improve federal research of bodies of water across the United States, including Puget Sound. The Bolstering Long Term Understanding and Exploration of the Great Lakes, Ocean, Bays and Estuaries, or?""BLUE GLOBE Act"",?would: - Require NOAA to conduct a focused study on future marine and maritime workforce needs; - Mandate that seral cooperative research institutes administered by NOAA prioritize the use of new technology to address current challenges in the ocean environments (for example, new technology and solutions needed to address the collection and removal of plastics in the ocean); - Establish an interagency program designed to provide a comprehensive ""Blue Economy"" assessment of value and impacts of natural resources, maritime industries, coastal communities, and military uses.?? * A requirement that the Maritime Administration, NOAA, and the EPA to conduct a study into the impact of contaminant-laden stormwater runoff on salmon and steelhead trout populations that return to spawn in urban streams across the Pacific Northwest, including: - Evaluating tire-related chemicals in stormwater runoff, and the impact of that runoff on salmon survival; - Providing recommendations for science and management needs to understand and ultimately address tire-related runoff. * A provision establishing Regional Ocean Partnerships to increase collaboration among states on shared ocean and coastal issues, including: - A $2.5 million authorization for the West Coast Ocean Alliance (WCOA), a partnership between Washington, Oregon, California and coastal Indian Tribes; - A $1 million authorization dedicated to supporting Tribal government engagement. The Makah, Quileute, and Quinault Nation Tribes are all members of WCOA. * Crackdowns on illegal fishing and forced labor, including: - A bill improving traceability and intergovernmental coordination needed to catch illegal fishermen on the high seas; - Training requirements for NOAA and Coast Guard personnel to identify instances of forced labor and child labor in the international fishing industry; - Stronger tools for NOAA and the Department of Homeland Security to end illegal fishing and forced labor, including denial of port privileges, improved certification, observer training, and capacity building in countries working to cut down on illegal fishing activity. The NDAA now heads to the Senate, where the bill is expected to be considered next week, before ultimately heading to the President's desk. * * * Original text here: https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/national-defense-bill-to-help-safeguard-habitat-for-puget-sound-orcas- Copyright Targeted News Services T40-MgEditor-8017080 T40-MgEditor Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); DEFENSE SPENDING (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); LEGISLATIVE VOTING (90%); MARINE MAMMALS (90%); MILITARY & VETERANS LAW (90%); POLLUTION (90%); US CONGRESS (90%); ARMED FORCES (89%); CETOLOGY (89%); CONSERVATION (89%); LIFE FORMS (89%); MAMMALS (89%); MARINE BIOLOGY (89%); MARINE CONSERVATION (89%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES (89%); NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS (89%); OCEANOGRAPHIC & ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES (89%); WILDLIFE (89%); COASTAL AREAS (88%); OIL SPILLS (88%); NEGATIVE NEWS (87%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (77%); NOISE POLLUTION (77%); OCEANOGRAPHY (77%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (77%); BIOLOGY (76%); MAMMALOGY (76%); ZOOLOGY (76%); DISASTER PLANNING (75%); OCEAN ECONOMY (75%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (74%); MARINE SHIPPING (73%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); EMERGENCY SERVICES (60%); GRANTS & GIFTS (60%) Organization: US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (84%); US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (54%) Industry: DEFENSE SPENDING (90%); ARMED FORCES (89%); MARINE CONSERVATION (89%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES (89%); OIL SPILLS (88%); MILITARY VESSELS (78%); BUDGETS (74%); MARINE SHIPPING (73%) Person: MARIA CANTWELL (90%) Geographic: WASHINGTON, USA (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); CANADA (73%)"
82,"The following information was released by Washington Senator Patty Murray: (Seattle, WA) Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, hosted a roundtable at the Seattle Aquarium to discuss her ongoing work to protect and restore the Puget Sound for generations to comeincluding by delivering funding for restoration and conservation efforts in last year's spending package, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Senator Murray was joined by Laura Blackmore, Executive Director of Puget Sound Partnership; Casey Sixkiller, Regional Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Region X; Justin Parker of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission; Dr. Erin Meyer, Director of Conservation Programs and Partnerships at Seattle Aquarium; Felicia Wibowo, a local sea kayaker; George Gronseth, owner of Kayak Academy; Bill Dewey, Director of Public Affairs at Taylor Shellfish Farms; and Willie Frank III, the Chairman of the Nisqually Tribe. ""The Puget Sound is one of Washington state's greatest treasures: it's absolutely central to our state's economy, environment, culture, and Tribal treaty rightsand it's critical we restore and protect it for generations to come. We owe it to our kids to leave them a Sound that's clean and protectedwhere salmon and orca are thrivingand that's why I've been so focused on making sure Congress delivers much-needed resources to protect and restore the Sound,"" said Senator Murray. "" I was proud to secure truly historic new investments in the Sound last Congress, and now I'm watching closely to make sure these federal dollars are being put to good useand as Congress intendedjust as I keep fighting to build on this progress in the other Washington."" ""With passage of the PUGET SOS act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction act, and increases in the EPA geographic program, we have the opportunity for transformative change across the region."" said Laura Blackmore, Executive Director of the Puget Sound Partnership. ""With these federal investments, we hope to supercharge our efforts to protect and restore habitat for our salmon, orcas, and other wildlife species, clean up the water, uphold tribal treaty rights, and cool our rivers and streams. We are deeply grateful for Senator Murray's continued leadership in championing these Puget Sound priorities."" ""This is both an historic and a particularly critical time for our efforts to protect Puget Sound,"" said Casey Sixkiller, Regional Administrator of EPA's Region 10 office in Seattle. ""The funding Senator Murray has secured will help accelerate protection and restoration projects while also supporting our efforts to ensure these projects equitably serve the needs of the diverse communities around the Sound."" ""Restoring Puget Sound is a long term commitment,"" said Bill Dewey, Director of Public Affairs at Taylor Shellfish Farms. ""The Senator's unwavering support to accomplish it, including this substantial new investment will ensure the Sound continues its reputation for producing world class shellfish."" In last year's spending bill, Senator Murray secured $54 million, the largest ever annual investment, for the Puget Sound Geographic Program. As Senate Appropriations Chair, Senator Murray will be fighting to protect and build on that funding in future spending bills. In that same spending bill, Senator Murray also personally secured $6 million for the Army Corps' Puget Sound Nearshore Marine Habitat restoration project and $1.5 million for the University of Washington to upgrade water monitoring systems in the Soundboth as a part of the overall $284 million Senator Murray secured in Congressionally-Directed Spending for local projects throughout Washington state. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Senator Murray also helped secure $89 million over 5 years for the Puget Sound Geographic Program. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also included a number of provisions that would benefit salmon and ecosystem restoration, including $172 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF), a grant program that provides funding to states and Tribes to protect, conserve, and restore endangered and threatened salmon populationsoverall the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers nearly $3 billion in funding opportunities for coastal infrastructure and climate change resilience. Senator Murray has made clear that Congress must take bold climate action, and was instrumental in passing the Inflation Reduction Act which delivers the largest investment in combating the climate crisis in American history. The Inflation Reduction Act provides a total of $3.3 billion for NOAAincluding $2.6 billion to support NOAA's climate, habitat restoration, and fisheries missions; $200 million for NOAA Facilities and National Marine Sanctuaries; and $20 million for more efficient NOAA environmental reviews. Senator Murray also passed the Puget Save Our Sound Act (Puget SOS Act) as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. The bill establishes a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office within the Environmental Protection Agency and in coordination with NOAA and other federal agencies. The Puget SOS Act would also codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting Puget Sound. Funding the Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office will be a top priority for Senator Murray. At the start of the event, Senator Murray also announced $354,608 in EPA funding for the Seattle Aquarium Society Bull Kelp Conservation and Restoration in Puget Sound.Kelp is the predominant habitat-forming species in temperate coastal ecosystems, it helps carry out critical ecological functions that support other species, it grows rapidly and has the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon, and it provides ecosystem services essential to human well-being. Puget Sound has experienced marked kelp declines in recent decades, with an overall 65% loss since 1980, and some areas exhibiting a 96% decline. ### Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: APPROPRIATIONS (90%); CONSERVATION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); US CONGRESS (90%); BIPARTISANSHIP (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); EXECUTIVES (89%); FISHES (89%); INDIGENOUS PEOPLES LAW (89%); INFLATION (89%); CANOEING & KAYAKING (88%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (77%); HABITAT CONSERVATION (77%); LAND RECLAMATION (77%); MARINE MAMMALS (77%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (77%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (76%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (75%); BOATING & RAFTING (73%); ECOSYSTEMS & HABITATS (72%); WILDLIFE (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (71%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (71%); BUSINESS NEWS (70%); SHELLFISH FARMING (68%); RIVERS (50%) Organization: US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%) Industry: ZOOS & AQUARIUMS (89%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (77%); AQUACULTURE (73%); SHELLFISH FARMING (68%) Person: PATTY MURRAY (90%) Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (94%); WASHINGTON, USA (99%); UNITED STATES (94%)"
83,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced $36 million in grant funds to state, local, Tribal and federal partners to support the continued conservation and restoration of Puget Sound. The funding was awarded from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Estuary Program and the Puget Sound Geographic Funds to support development and implementation of the Puget Sound Action Agenda. ""With this $36 million investment in Puget Sound, government agencies and Tribes will work to stop stormwater pollution, improve water quality, restore habitat and accelerate the recovery of our salmon and orca populations.

""Puget Sound is vital to so many Tribes and communities throughout Washington state. It's central to our economy, our environment, and our way of life. Salmon, shellfish, orcas, and the families who have grown up on the water's edge count on it to be healthy and vibrant,"" said Senator Murray. ""We owe it to future generations to preserve this precious ecosystem and its native wildlife -- and this funding I worked to pass will help Washington state do just that. I'm glad we are able to make these critical investments, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to protect the Sound and ensure it is clean, safe, and thriving for years to come."" The total $36 million will be allocated to the following programs: * $8.5 million to the Puget Sound Partnership. The Puget Sound Partnership will also receive $900,000 in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding. * $7.0 million to 19 federally recognized Tribes, the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, Skagit River System Cooperative and Point no Point Treaty Council * $7.2 million to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and Washington Department of Natural Resources for habitat recovery * $5.7 million to the Department of Ecology for stormwater work, including transportation runoff * $4.5 million to Washington Department of Health for shellfish restoration and pathogen reduction * $3.3 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for federal science through Interagency Agreements with NOAA, USGS, USFS and DOE According to EPA, Congress has appropriated over $420 million in Clean Water Act National Estuary Program and Geographic Program funds for Puget Sound since 2006. State, local, Tribal and federal partners have used these funds to leverage nearly $2.1 billion of additional funds largely from the state of Washington. These grants have helped restore more than 50,000 acres of habitat, increased protection of over 150,000 acres of harvestable shellfish beds, and funded cutting edge research on chemicals in automobiles and roadway runoff. Throughout their time in the Senate, Sens. Cantwell and Murray have been staunch advocates of conservation and restoration investments for Puget Sound, and protecting and strengthening critical salmon populations. In 2021, Cantwell and Murray secured historic investments for salmon recovery, including $89 million for the Puget Sound Geographic Program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That bill also included a number of provisions that would benefit salmon and ecosystem restoration, including $172 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF), a grant program that provides funding to states and Tribes to protect, conserve, and restore endangered and threatened salmon populations.

86,"A voluntary slowdown trial for large ships in Admiralty Inlet and north Puget Sound to lessen the impact of underwater noise on endangered killer whales has proven to be successful so far. The trial, which was originally planned from Oct. 24 to Dec. 22, has been extended to Jan. 12 in order to collect more data. It is led by Quiet Sound, a part of Maritime Blue, an organization that is dedicated to making the maritime industry more sustainable and equitable. The slowdown is an attempt to better the lives of southern resident killer whales, a distinct population of orcas that spend several months of the year in Puget Sound. These whales are a critically endangered species. There are currently only 73 of them; it is estimated that a stable population would be about 150 to 200 whales. Vessel noise affects orcas because the animals use echolocation to find the fish they eat. The noise from boat propellers is in the same frequency orcas use to hunt and communicate. The slowdown applies to commercial vessels such as ferries, cargo and carrier ships, vehicle carriers, bulkers, tankers and tug boats. Quiet Sound held a press event on Dec. 9 at the Seattle Aquarium to share results of the trial thus far. Gov. Jay Inslee and Tacoma and Seattle port commissioners were in attendance. Quiet Sound was created as part of Inslee's orca recovery task force, a response to the declining number of killer whales. Quiet Sound Program Director Rachel Aronson shared that 61% of ships in Puget Sound are slowing down by 30 to 50%. The slowdown has protected the whales 75% of the days they were in Puget Sound. Whales were in the slowdown area for 52% of the trial. ""It is going just as we had hoped,"" Quiet Sound Project Manager Caitlin O'Morchoe said. ""Maybe a little bit better than our worst fears that the whales were not going to show up or no one was going to participate."" She said it was possible that no whales would be in the slowdown area if they had expanded their foraging area to eat more prey. The southern residents eat fish like Chinook salmon, another endangered species. Quiet Sound was modeled after the Canadian ECHO program, which has been doing slowdowns for several years for whales off the coast of British Columbia. The ECHO program had a similar participation rate in its first year. Now, six years later, the participation rate is up to 93%. Quiet Sound installed an underwater microphone earlier this week to collect noise data. Data will be recorded for the rest of the trial and then afterward to compare the amount of noise. It's too soon to say if the slowdown is having any effects on whale behavior. ""The real effects are going to be generations to come,"" O'Morchoe said. The long term goal of southern resident killer whale conservation efforts is to return the population to a number that is self-sustaining, but that could take years and would result from a combination of many factors.

87,"If you see an orca this time of year, there's a good chance it's one of the transient variety. Glimpses of transient orcas in the Salish Sea have increased over the last few years, with the Whidbey-based Orca Network recording about 100 more sightings this year as compared to the same time last year. The plentiful population of killer whales — which are actually a type of large dolphin — likely owes its success to its diet of other marine mammals, mainly harbor seals, sea lions and porpoises. They are also known to munch on an occasional seabird or even a squid. ""Because those populations are so healthy, these are places where the whales know they can come in and find abundant food,"" said Stephanie Raymond, a Seattle resident who is the program manager for the Orca Network. In 2021, the whale-tracking nonprofit logged three times as many sightings of transient orcas – also known as Bigg's killer whales – compared to southern resident orcas. Sightings of southern residents, an endangered community of fish-eating orcas, outpaced transients only during the months of November and December. As recently as May 1, the same group of transient orcas were seen swimming back and forth between Holmes Harbor and Baby Island multiple times, presumably on the hunt for a meal. Those who are curious about recent sightings can visit Orca Network's Facebook page. Sightings can be reported there, at orcanetwork.org or by calling 866-ORCANET (672-2638). Bigg's killer whales are currently booming in population, numbering around 400 individuals, according to the Georgia Strait Alliance. At the same time, the salmon-eating southern resident orcas are waning, with a total population of 74, according to the Marine Mammal Commission. ""They are successfully having calves in the way that southern residents aren't,"" Raymond said of the transients. She added that it has been noteworthy to see transients traveling deeper and deeper into Puget Sound recently. She said she didn't recall seeing T063 – also known as Chainsaw – swimming down into Central and South Puget Sound before, but now he is. ""Now we're seeing these larger groups, the super pods, where there are four or five families traveling together or at least meeting up for a little bit,"" she said. Unlike gray whales or humpbacks, Bigg's killer whales have no migratory pattern and have been spotted year-round in the Salish Sea. Raymond explained that while they have a wider range to swim in than the southern residents, it appears they may be drawn to the Pacific Northwest more and more for the abundance of harbor seals, which are easy prey. Southern residents, meanwhile, have specific areas they must seek out for salmon. Chinook salmon, in particular, have been threatened by habitat loss. Although they may look identical to the untrained eye, transients and southern residents have some subtle differences. Raymond said there are different characteristics of saddle patches and dorsal fins, as well as teeth. The two ecotypes speak separate languages and have cultures unique to each other. And they don't interact – Raymond has even witnessed a pod of transient orcas and a pod of southern resident orcas traveling in opposite directions without acknowledging each other. In fact, scientists estimate transients diverged from other killer whales to create their own ecotype about 700,000 years ago, according to the Smithsonian. While Bigg's killer whales appear to be faring better because of more plentiful prey, there is some hope for the southern residents. A few weeks ago, a video of a new calf in K pod emerged. ""That's a very hopeful sign,"" Raymond said. ""That pod had not had another live birth since 2011.""

88,"Oct 31, 2022( Axios: http://axios.com Delivered by Newstex)   A trial is underway to see if reducing the speed of large ships in Puget Sound can help protect the endangered southern resident killer whale, also known as orcas.  Driving the news: The voluntary slowdown, aimed at decreasing underwater noise, is the first of its kind, according to Quiet Sound[1], a collaboration among scientists, government agencies, the shipping industry, the U.S. military and tribal groups.  Why it matters: Only 73 southern resident killer[2] whales remain, grouped in three matriarchal social units, the J, K and L pods. The ability of the killer whales to navigate, communicate and hunt for salmon in Admiralty Inlet and north Puget Sound is threatened by underwater noise pollution caused by passing vessels, according to Quiet Sound. Details: The noise-reducing effort, which began last week and will continue through Dec. 22, aims to create 20 nautical miles of quieter whale habitat by encouraging vessel operators to reduce speed in designated areas by 30-50% when feasible and safe. Information from Ocean Wise, Orca Network, Acartia, Conserve.io and members of the public who report sightings, as well as whale presence data recorded using the WhaleReport Alert System (WRAS)[3], is reported to mariners in real time. Quiet Sound is using underwater microphones to monitor noise levels during and after the slowdown to determine the effectiveness of the trial.Early data from the trial will be released Dec. 9. Flashback: Puget Sound's whales made news internationally in 2018 when grieving mother Tahlequah, also known as J35, carried her dead baby calf on her head[4] for 17 days over thousands of miles.  What they're saying: 'The shipping industry is becoming more aware of the impacts on whales of shipping and undersea noise,' Puget Sound Pilots president Ivan Carlson said. 'We want to continue to make the Puget Sound a place where southern resident killer whales thrive and safely return for years to come,' said Quiet Sound program director Rachel Aronson. Want to help? Members of the public can help by reporting whale sightings through the Orca Network[5], the WhaleReport app (on Apple[6] and Android[7]) or the Whale Alert app (on Apple[8] and Android[9]).

89,"by Jefferson Freeman Orcas High School student The Orcas Vikings soccer team is heading to the state semifinals this weekend. After securing the league title, the Vikings got a matchup with the Auburn Adventist Falcons in the district playoffs on Nov. 1. Traveling to Sedro-Woolley the Vikings were the acting home team for that matchup — facing an Auburn team that was playing their best ball of the season but had fallen to second in their league. The Falcons came out strong and proved to be a brute reminder of what playoff soccer looked like. This would prove no issue to the Vikings, however, as Diego Lago would get on the end of a corner from Sam Sutton to give the Vikings an early 1-0 lead. Lago would spend the rest of the night anchoring the back line as they held onto a clean sheet and a 1-0 victory. The district final would match the Vikings with their rival Friday Harbor Wolverines on Nov. 5. Sutton's screamer from the edge of the box would give the Vikings a lead but the Wolverines would equalize, taking the game to extra time and eventually penalties that would go eight rounds with the Wolverines winning, 5-4. The Vikings moved on to the first round of state playoffs on Nov. 11. The matchups were as follows: Friday Harbor vs. Puget Sound Adventist; Upper Colombia Academy vs. Mount Vernon Christian; Orcas Island vs Evergreen Lutheran; and Saint George's vs. Auburn Adventist. Friday Harbor would beat Puget Sound on a free kick late in the first half went in and the Sharks hit the crossbar in the final minutes. The upset of the tournament would come as MVC scored the final two goals of their match to be second-ranked Upper Colombia, 2-1. Saint George's and Auburn would need penalty kicks to decide a winner and it would be Saint George's sneaking by. The Vikings would be on the favorable side of the day's most lopsided matchup, as they won 6-1. Nicholas Rivera got the first goal, banging one in from the top of the box. Evergreen would get the next goal to make it 1-1 but it was no worry for the Vikings as Ethan Moss found Tommy Anderson-Cleveland who would score the go-ahead. Anderson-Cleveland quickly got another goal after receiving a pass from Kevin Ibarra Garcia, dribbling through a mass of Evergreen defenders and essentially putting a nail in the coffin. The fourth goal would come via Jefferson Freeman as Sutton led him into wide open space and the Vikings' fourth goal. Freshman Anthony Conejo would get the fifth goal in his playoff debut. Anderson-Cleveland's goal celebration was one of the highlights of the game, as he paid tribute to former Viking Skyler Gregg, who was recently killed serving in the defense of Ukraine. The Vikings wore black bands and will continue to do so in honor of Gregg's memory and sacrifice. After the victory against Evergreen, the Vikings move on to the state semifinals. The team will play Mount Vernon Christian on Nov. 18 at 1 p.m. at the Renton Memorial Stadium.

90,"As spring approaches, thousands of Alaskan fishing families don't yet know if they will be allowed to fish for the prized Chinook salmon this year. For full-time commercial fishermen like myself who rely on Chinook as a primary source of income, not being allowed to troll this year would be devastating to my family and Southeast's rural communities. That's why Southeast's trollers are so appreciative of the dozens of communities (most recently Juneau), associations, and businesses that have stepped up with letters of support, resolutions, and donations as Alaska's trollers fight to save Southeast's troll fishery from the Seattle-based Wild Fish Conservancy's misguided lawsuit against the National Marine Fisheries Service. If the Wild Fish Conservancy gets their way with the courts, then Alaska's winter and summer Chinook troll fishery will be shut down and Puget Sound's orcas and Chinook will continue to suffer from habitat loss, toxic pollution and urbanization in the Pacific Northwest. Alaska's trollers are known as some of the most sustainable and conservation-minded fishermen on the water. Our fish are individually hand-caught with hook-and-line gear and delicately handled as soon as they come onboard, fetching some of the highest prices per pound in the marketplace. Every fish matters and we are always thinking about the health and productivity of the wild salmon that our bottom lines depend on. That's why trollers are some of the most vocal advocates you'll see when it comes to protecting salmon habitat, reducing bycatch, and addressing climate change. We are actively involved in efforts to stop large-scale mines in Southeast's Transboundary Rivers and remove impassable dams on the Columbia's Snake River. Despite all that, the Wild Fish Conservancy has resorted to scapegoating Alaska's trollers rather than working with us to save Puget Sound's orcas and Chinook. Thankfully, Alaska's leaders have taken note and are taking steps to protect Southeast's trollers and Alaska's single-largest private sector employer: the commercial fishing industry. We were heartened by Alaska State House Special Committee on Fisheries' hearing on Feb. 14, where I and other fishermen and experts spoke to the potentially devastating impacts of the Wild Fish Conservancy's lawsuit. In my testimony, I shared that, not only will this lawsuit kill our fishery and our way of life, but it also sets a very dangerous precedent to allow for highly politicized, knee-jerk reactionary pleas to judges to drive fishery management rather than highly trained state and federal biologists and fishery managers. Alaska Department of Fish and Game's managers have a very good handle on how to manage our salmon fisheries sustainably with decades of proven success doing so. To dismiss their work and expertise and instead allow micromanaged biology from the bench is very scary. I see this as a potential Pandora's box and a blatant violation of justice. Why is Wild Fish Conservancy not going after the Columbia River's dams? Why not the industrial polluters? Why not the trawl fleet that catches more Chinook than our troll fleet? That's because, to me, this lawsuit was never about making it better for Puget Sound's orcas. Instead, Wild Fish Conservancy's lawsuit is part of their larger effort to shut down small-boat fisheries and end what little opportunity remains to harvest Chinook. The people behind this lawsuit, they don't know what it means to live in a tiny village, in tune with nature, as has been done for thousands of years. They don't appreciate that catching Chinook salmon is more than our livelihood, it's the very essence of our soul. It is who we are. If you take that away from us, you kill us too. After hearing our testimony, the Committee passed House Joint Resolution No. 5, calling on federal and state agencies to defend Alaska's fisheries, including the Southeast Alaska troll fishery, and ensure that Southeast's troll fleet can fish this summer as we have for over 100 years. We commend the committee for formalizing their support for Alaska's fishing families and the economic stability and resiliency of our rural coastal communities. We encourage Alaska's State Senate to join them and pass the joint resolution, demonstrating that Alaska will not stand by quietly as Wild Fish Conservancy tries to wipe Alaska's fishing families off the map. ߦ Casey Mapes is a commercial salmon troller who lives in Yakutat, Alaska.

91,"Submitted by the Center for Biological Diversity. A bill to create a 1,000-yard buffer around the critically endangered Southern Resident orcas is headed to Gov. Jay Inslee's desk for his signature after clearing a final legislative hurdle on Monday. Senate Bill 5371 requires that boaters stay 1,000 yards away from Southern Residents, beginning in 2025. National and regional conservation groups and environmental experts celebrated the bill's passage and encouraged boaters to take the voluntary pledge at givethemspace.org until the law takes effect. The Senate bill was sponsored by Sen. Liz Lovelett (D-Anacortes) and championed by Rep. Debra Lekanoff (D-Bow) during negotiations. The original House companion bill was sponsored by Rep. Liz Berry (D-Seattle). ""Our constituents have been loud and clear in voicing strong support for taking the hard but necessary steps to protect our iconic resident orcas from extinction,"" said Lovelett. ""SB 5371 has passed with overwhelming support and shows our commitment to the survival of these beloved creatures who are emblematic of the health of the Salish Sea. I'm proud to have worked with my colleagues to bring a voice to these animals as they fight to survive and thrive."" The law implements a recommendation from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife based on recent science showing that when vessels approach closer than 1,000 yards it significantly reduces the whales' ability to find and catch prey. The harm from noise and disturbance is more pronounced on females, who abandon hunts when vessels approach closer than 400 yards. Currently, commercial whale-watching operators are required to stay 1,000 yards away from Southern Residents most of the year, while other boaters are allowed to approach as close as 300 yards. The new law resolves that difference. Having one distance for all boaters will give the whales the space they need to forage successfully and be easier to communicate, comply with and enforce. The Southern Resident orca population currently consists of 73 individuals, nearing their historical low of 71. ""There are seven calves under five years of age in the population, including Tahlequah's newest calf, and five of those are female,"" said Donna Sandstrom, director of The Whale Trail. ""The future of the population is here. Their ability to survive and thrive into adulthood depends on the actions that we take today."" ""The legislation is a strong step forward. We are grateful to the bill's champions from the 40th District, Sen. Lovelett and Rep. Lekanoff, as well as WDFW and the many scientists, organizations, Tribes, local governments, and members of the public who stepped up for the Southern Residents in this legislative session,"" said Lovel Pratt, marine protection and policy director at Friends of the San Juans. ""Public support for this bill was overwhelming."" Boaters are encouraged to take the pledge at givethemspace.org to stay 1,000 yards away from the Southern Residents voluntarily.

92,"Submitted by the Center for Biological Diversity. A bill to create a 1,000-yard buffer around the critically endangered Southern Resident orcas is headed to Gov. Jay Inslee's desk for his signature after clearing a final legislative hurdle on Monday. Senate Bill 5371 requires that boaters stay 1,000 yards away from Southern Residents, beginning in 2025. National and regional conservation groups and environmental experts celebrated the bill's passage and encouraged boaters to take the voluntary pledge at givethemspace.org until the law takes effect. The Senate bill was sponsored by Sen. Liz Lovelett (D-Anacortes) and championed by Rep. Debra Lekanoff (D-Bow) during negotiations. The original House companion bill was sponsored by Rep. Liz Berry (D-Seattle). ""Our constituents have been loud and clear in voicing strong support for taking the hard but necessary steps to protect our iconic resident orcas from extinction,"" said Lovelett. ""SB 5371 has passed with overwhelming support and shows our commitment to the survival of these beloved creatures who are emblematic of the health of the Salish Sea. I'm proud to have worked with my colleagues to bring a voice to these animals as they fight to survive and thrive."" The law implements a recommendation from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife based on recent science showing that when vessels approach closer than 1,000 yards it significantly reduces the whales' ability to find and catch prey. The harm from noise and disturbance is more pronounced on females, who abandon hunts when vessels approach closer than 400 yards. Currently, commercial whale-watching operators are required to stay 1,000 yards away from Southern Residents most of the year, while other boaters are allowed to approach as close as 300 yards. The new law resolves that difference. Having one distance for all boaters will give the whales the space they need to forage successfully and be easier to communicate, comply with and enforce. The Southern Resident orca population currently consists of 73 individuals, nearing their historical low of 71. ""There are seven calves under five years of age in the population, including Tahlequah's newest calf, and five of those are female,"" said Donna Sandstrom, director of The Whale Trail. ""The future of the population is here. Their ability to survive and thrive into adulthood depends on the actions that we take today."" ""The legislation is a strong step forward. We are grateful to the bill's champions from the 40th District, Sen. Lovelett and Rep. Lekanoff, as well as WDFW and the many scientists, organizations, Tribes, local governments, and members of the public who stepped up for the Southern Residents in this legislative session,"" said Lovel Pratt, marine protection and policy director at Friends of the San Juans. ""Public support for this bill was overwhelming."" Boaters are encouraged to take the pledge at givethemspace.org to stay 1,000 yards away from the Southern Residents voluntarily. Nearly 200 people have taken the pledge since the campaign was launched in September 2020.

93,"Sep 20, 2019( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex) ; ABOARD THE TYEE III, CENTRAL PUGET SOUND — J and K pod orcas visited local waters Thursday, including the newest baby born to the endangered southern residents. The littlest J pod whale wagged her tiny pectoral fins as her mother playfully pushed her through the waves near the south end of Whidbey Island. The whales spyhopped and leapt, looking playful and sleek, as the last rays of summer sun shone on their dorsal fins.  Their puff and blow was primal, powerful, a sound like something from the beginning of time. It was a rare visit this year as the orcas have been spending most of their time on the outer coast of Washington, where the federal government has proposed expanding the whales' critical habitat. Brad Hanson, researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, worked with a crew through the afternoon aboard a NOAA research boat, gathering fecal samples with a long-handled net. The material was pink with salmon and thick and fatty: the sign of a good meal, perhaps. These samples are of infinite value to scientists, who can deduce from them what the whales were eating and even, through DNA analysis, where the fish came from. Advertising'It has opened a whole new door,' said Hanson, as he wrangled the net to scoop up another bit of viscous whale poo. Maya Sears and Rachael Cumberland, research assistants on the crew, worked quickly to gather the samples from the net, coax them into plastic vials and stow them in a cooler. They would hustle the samples back to Friday Harbor Labs later the same day, to freeze for later analysis. The agency has about 1,000 such samples by now, compiled over the years, many by this team. Great wheels of gulls turned over the whales, perhaps hoping for fish scraps. Hanson vied with them for the fecal samples, which smelled pungently of fish. 'That's my sample!' he said to a gull swooping to the water's surface. The orca field season this year has been challenging for researchers, with the orcas spending much of their time on the coast. The southern residents surprised everyone by turning up in Central Puget Sound this week. Normally, they are in the San Juan Islands this time of year. AdvertisingOnly 73 orcas remain in the southern resident pods, the lowest number since they were captured for aquariums in the 1960s and '70s. The secrets unlocked in the whales' scat could reveal solutions for their survival. The rumble of a train down the shore, the ferries slinking back and forth and the sight of the Seattle skyline in the distance made the whales' presence right here, amid millions of us, all the sweeter. Their black dorsals cut the blue water and the sound of the orcas' blows came from every direction as they hunted fish, horsed around and played.With excellent vision (they can even see backward, to their tail) and a strong tactile sense, they seemed to take huge pleasure spyhopping for a look around and hurling themselves through the air, landing with a splash. Even Hanson seemed transfixed, even as he worked, by the grace and power of the animals that have fascinated him since he, as a boy, first saw Namu the killer whale on the Seattle waterfront. 'It never gets old,' Hanson said, and reached out for another sample. Lynda V. Mapes: 206-464-2515 or lmapes@seattletimes.com[1]; on Twitter: @LyndaVMapes[2].

94,"SEATTLE - With the number of endangered Puget Sound orcas at a 30-year low, state lawmakers want to protect the fish-eating killer whales that spend time in the inland waters of the Salish Sea.  The measures range from boosting hatchery salmon production to increasing marine patrols so boats keep their distance from the whales.  Many have been sounding the alarm about the orcas' plight since the September death of a juvenile brought the population to 76. Orcas face threats from lack of food, pollution and noise from vessels.  A baby orca has not been born in the past few years. Half of the calves born during a celebrated baby boom have since died. Female orcas are also having pregnancy problems linked to nutritional stress brought on by a low supply of chinook salmon, the whales' preferred food, a recent study found.  ""We haven't seen any viable calves born here in the last few years and that is disconcerting,"" said Brad Hanson, wildlife biologist with the NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center.  Last year, the orcas spent the fewest number of days in the central Salish Sea in four decades, mostly because there weren't enough salmon for them to eat, said Ken Balcomb, senior scientist with the Center for Whale Research.  One House bill sets aside $1.5 million to produce 10 million more hatchery chinook salmon - a roughly 20 percent boost - so orcas will have more to eat.  ""Using smart hatchery production we can still support rebuilding wild fish runs and have hatchery production,"" said Rep. Brian Blake, D-Aberdeen, prime sponsor of House Bill 2417, which unanimously cleared a policy committee and awaits action in a fiscal committee.  Blake and other says there's growing awareness that the fates of two Northwest iconic species - salmon and orcas - are intertwined, and that efforts to save one endangered species could help another.  ""The idea is that, overall, you have more fish out there that are available to killer whales,"" said Penny Becker, wildlife diversity division manager with the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.  She said the agency is committed to ramping up state hatchery production - which has been declining over the past decade - though it would still need to determine where and how best to do that.  Putting more fish in the waters won't necessarily mean whales will get them all. A recent study found that other marine mammals such as sea lions, seals and other killer whales were also feasting on the salmon that Puget Sound orcas prize.  Recreational and commercial fishermen groups told lawmakers that increasing supply would benefit fishermen and orcas.  But some skeptics think it should only be a short-term strategy and that efforts should focus on restoring salmon habitat or removing fish barriers including dams.  ""We can't stop there. We've got to have a more comprehensive approach that restores ecosystem health,"" said Joseph Bogaard, executive director with Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition pushing to remove four Snake River dams.  Kurt Beardslee, executive director of the Wild Fish Conservancy, said officials should be looking to limit salmon harvest so orcas can have their share rather than increasing production that could potentially harm wild salmon.  Meanwhile, state Sen. Kevin Ranker, D-Orcas Island, has proposed a package of bills aimed at protecting orcas and the waters they swim in.  Senate Bill 6268 would essentially double to 100 the number of days state wildlife officers are on the water to keep boats a safe distance from orcas.  Orcas use clicks, calls and other sounds to navigate, communicate and forage mainly for salmon. Noise from vessels can interfere with that.  ""We need to continue working on toxins and salmon, but there are issues that we can take on right now,"" Ranker said.  His bill would also convene a meeting between experts in British Columbia and Washington to discuss strategies to help the orcas.  Gov. Jay Inslee's proposed supplemental budget devotes $3 million to helping the whales by increasing enforcement of boat regulations, increasing production of chinook salmon at hatcheries and improving habitat. Inslee is also expected to create a killer whale task force.

97,"The Center for Food Safety issued the following news release: Cooke Aquaculture, the company responsible for the 2017 release of over 250,000 nonnative Atlantic salmon into Washington's Puget Sound, will face a new challenge to their proposal to raise domesticated steelhead in their Puget Sound net pens. Today, conservation and environmental groups filed an appeal directly to the Washington Supreme Court challenging a ruling by a lower court that would allow Cooke's new project to move forward without adequate environmental review. In February, Wild Fish Conservancy and co-counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety, and Friends of the Earth, filed a lawsuit challenging the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's (WDFW) decision to permit Cooke to stock steelhead in their Puget Sound net pens. The lawsuit argued that WDFW violated state law by issuing the permit without conducting an environmental impact statement (EIS), a comprehensive scientific review that fully analyzes the environmental impacts to threatened and endangered species, water quality, and the overall health of Puget Sound's ecosystem. ""In filing this lawsuit and the appeal, we are simply asking Washington Fish and Wildlife to do their due diligence and fully analyze potential environmental impacts before making a decision on whether or not to permit this new project,"" commented Kurt Beardslee, Executive Director of Wild Fish Conservancy. ""The current inadequate review sets an unacceptably low bar for what level of risk and uncertainty are acceptable when it comes to making decisions with the potential to endanger the health of Puget Sound's wild fish."" In early November, a Superior Court Judge ruled the Court owes deference to the agency's interpretation of the law and science because the Court does not have the scientific expertise necessary to overrule the agency's findings. As a result, the Court upheld WDFW's analysis and review of the science that determined Cooke's project will not pose significant environmental impacts and therefore does not require an EIS. ""The question at the heart of this lawsuit is whether or not the agency's environmental review of the science sufficiently considered the risks posed by Cooke's new project,"" says Beardslee. ""The Court's decision to rely on the expertise of the very agency being challenged means the scientific merits of this case have not been considered. The health of our Sound is far too important, we will appeal this case directly to the Supreme Court."" During the public comment period reviewing WDFW's environmental review process, the agency reported unprecedented participation, with over 3,500 comments submitted by the public, including fishery and killer whale experts, conservation organizations, commercial and recreational fishing groups, and six Tribal Nations. These comments overwhelmingly called for the agency to withdraw their initial decision and conduct a full EIS before permitting Cooke's new project. Even the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), a jurisdictional agency to the review process, submitted comments expressing concerns that were never addressed by WDFW in their environmental review process. The risks and environmental harm posed by marine finfish net pen aquaculture are well-documented in the evidentiary and scientific record. In May 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made a new Endangered Species Act (ESA) determination finding that Puget Sound net pens ""are likely to adversely affect"" ESA-listed salmon, steelhead, and rockfish in Puget Sound. The National Marine Fisheries Service is currently preparing a biological opinion to further analyze this initial finding. In trial, WDFW argued there was no agency record of environmental harm in Puget Sound posed by commercial marine finfish aquaculture. Wild Fish Conservancy and partners' arguments were supported by the Swinomish Tribal Nation who submitted an amicus brief in the case in August. In an attempt to silence the Tribe, a legal co-manager, from participating in the lawsuit, Cooke and WDFW joined together in calling for the Judge to dismiss the amicus entirely. In their legal filings, the Tribe expressed their concerns over the impacts Cooke's Hope Island net pen facility poses to the Tribe's treaty rights, Skagit River salmon runs, and other fishery resources. Additional Quotes: ""Net-pen farming in Puget Sound promotes private profit over public resource preservation,"" said Amy van Saun, senior attorney at Center for Food Safety. ""We will continue fighting this harmful practice to help to protect our endangered salmon and orca for future generations."" ""Fish factory farming has no place in Puget Sound,"" said Sophia Ressler, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Doing the work to fully understand how this project could harm our waters and endangered wildlife is absolutely vital to protecting our state waters, and the failure to require this will be destructive."" ""We are disappointed that the lower court has upheld WDFW's inadequate environmental review of Cooke's destructive net pens,"" said Hallie Templeton, senior oceans campaigner and deputy legal director at Friends of the Earth. ""We will appeal the flawed decision that allows Cooke's floating factory farms to persist in Puget Sound, further destroying water quality and our endangered salmon and orcas.""

98,"SEATTLE - Two more Puget Sound orcas are ailing and probably will be dead by summer, according an expert on the critically endangered population of killer whales that live in the waters of the Pacific Northwest. Drone photography taken this past September showed the ailing population of orcas known as the southern residents went into the winter thinner than they were when the whales arrived in the San Juan Islands last summer. They also are thinner than Puget Sound's so-called northern resident population of killer whales, which have been steadily growing in population for the past 40 years in their home waters primarily in northern British Columbia and southeast Alaska, where they have access to more fish and cleaner and quieter water. The northern residents gave birth to 10 new calves last year. The Seattle Times reports Center for Whale Research founding director Ken Balcomb said photos taken of a southern resident orca known as J17 on New Year's Eve showed the 42-year-old female has so-called peanut head - a misshapen head and neck caused by starvation. In addition a 27-year-old male known as K25 is failing, also from lack of sufficient food. He lost his mother, K13, in 2017 and is not successfully foraging on his own. Several southern resident whales were documented to be pregnant in September, but so far there has been no sign of babies. The southern residents have not had a successful pregnancy in three years. The southern resident population is at a 35-year low after three deaths in 2018. There are only 74 left. Losing J17 would be a blow to the southern residents because she is a female still of reproducing age, said Deborah Giles, research scientist for University of Washington Center for Conservation Biology. Giles said she was not surprised to hear about K25. The social dynamics of the southern residents, in which older females help their pod, and especially their sons by sharing food, is both a blessing and a curse if that female dies, Giles said. ""These large, adult, hungry males benefit by the females in their family,"" Giles said. ""There probably is still family foraging going on, but not like he had when his mom was alive."" The coming year is not looking any easier for the southern residents in terms of their food supply. The whales mostly eat chinook salmon. Ocean conditions and poor river migration, with warm water and low flows, have hurt chinook salmon returns in the past several years. Last month, two new areas off Vancouver Island were designated as protected critical habitat for resident killer whales by the Canadian government. Fisheries and Oceans Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said at the time the decision means key foraging locations for the endangered whales are protected from destruction. The government is increasing the amount of protected habitat from about 6,400 square kilometres to roughly 10,700 square kilometres. The new protected area is intended to help recovery efforts for northern and southern resident killer whales, and covers an area off southwestern Vancouver Island. The state of Washington also recently announced US$1.1 billion in spending and a partial whale-watching ban in an attempt to help the population's recovery. The money would go toward protecting and restoring habitat for salmon, boosting production from salmon hatcheries, storm-water cleanup and quieting vessel traffic. - With files from The Canadian Press Classification Language: ENGLISH Document-Type: news Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: MARINE MAMMALS (93%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (90%); CONSERVATION (89%); FISHES (89%); POPULATION GROWTH (89%); AGING (78%); BIOLOGY (78%); CETOLOGY (78%); ECOSYSTEMS & HABITATS (78%); MAMMALOGY (78%); MARINE BIOLOGY (78%); MARINE CONSERVATION (78%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); ZOOLOGY (78%); STARVATION (77%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (74%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (74%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (73%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (73%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (73%); International (%); National (%); Human Interest (%); Environment (%); Fisheries (%) Industry: PRESS AGENCY RELEASES (90%); MARINE CONSERVATION (78%) Geographic: SEATTLE, WA, USA (93%); WASHINGTON, USA (94%); BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA (92%); ALASKA, USA (79%); NORTHWEST USA (79%); CANADA (93%); Seattle; Washington; United States"

100,"Jan 02, 2019( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex) Two more orcas are ailing and probably will be dead by summer, according to the region's expert on the demographics of the critically endangered southern residents. Ken Balcomb, founding director of the Center for Whale Research[1], said photos taken of J17 on New Year's Eve showed the 42-year-old female has so-called peanut head, a misshapen head and neck caused by starvation. In addition K25, a 27-year-old male, is failing, also from lack of sufficient food. He lost his mother, K13, in 2017 and is not successfully foraging on his own.'I am confident we are going to lose them sometime before summer,' Balcomb said. Drone photography this past summer showed K25 to be noticeably thinner, and photos taken of him again in this winter show no improvement, Balcomb said. Hostile Waters: Orcas in Peril[2]  https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/i-am-worried-and-i-am-afraid-two-more-puget-sound-orcas-predicted-to-die-in-critically-endangered-population/st.news/HostileWatersABOUT THIS SERIES[3] In the weeks and months ahead, The Seattle Times' 'Hostile Waters' series will continue to explore and expose the plight of the southern resident killer whales, among the most-enduring symbols of our region and most-endangered animals. We'll examine the role humans have played in their decline, what can be done about it and why it matters. Several whales were documented to be pregnant back in September, but so far there has been no sign of any babies. The southern residents have not had a successful pregnancy in three years. The troubling news comes on top of a grim year in 2018 for the southern residents, the J, K, and L pods of fish-eating orcas that frequent the Salish Sea, which includes Puget Sound and the transboundary waters of the United States and Canada, as well as the West Coast of the United States.

By signing up, you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy[5] and Terms of Service[6].The southern resident population is at a 35-year low after three deaths this past year in four months. There are only 74 left.'I am going to stop counting at 70,' Balcomb said. 'What is the point?'Losing J17 would be a blow to the southern residents because she is a female still of reproducing age, said Deborah Giles,research scientist for University of WashingtonCenter for Conservation Biology[7]and research director for nonprofitWild Orca.[8] Giles said she was not surprised to hear about K25. The social dynamics of the southern residents, in which older females help their pod, and especially their sons by sharing food[9], is both a blessing and a curse if that female dies, Giles said.'These large, adult, hungry males benefit by the females in their family,' Giles said. 'There probably is still family foraging going on, but not like he had when his mom was alive.'As for J17, 'that is the worst of those two, the thought of losing her, she is such an important member for the southern resident community,' Giles said.J17 is the mother of J35, or Tahlequah, who moved people around the world when in 2018 she carried her dead calf that lived for only one half-hour on her head for more than 1,000 miles over the course of 17 days[10].The family already has been through a lot. 'We have no idea what that grandmother went through, watching her daughter carry around that baby as long as she did,' Giles said. 'What would that have been like. To watch your daughter go through that grief and not have much you can do about it.'The same family in 2016 also lost J54, a 1-year-old whale the whole family tried to support, especially his sister, J46, feeding him, and lifting the baby whale up with their teeth every time he started to sink. 'The other whales were trying to support him,' Balcomb said. 'He had tooth rakes all over his body, but it wasn't malicious, he was sinking.' It is hard to confront a new year with two whales already failing, Giles said. 'It is this anticipatory grief. I am worried. And I am afraid.'Drone photography taken this past September showed the southern residents went into the winter thinner than they were when the whales arrived in the San Juan Islands last summer. They also are thinner than the northern residents, which have been steadily growing in population[11] for the past 40 years in their home waters primarily in northern B.C. and southeast Alaska, where they have access to more fish, and cleaner and quieter water. The northern residents gave birth to 10 new calves last year. The southern residents look particularly thin next to the seal-eating transient, or Bigg's, killer whales. 'They are like marshmallows,' Balcomb said. The coming year is not looking any easier for the southern residents in terms of their food supply. The whales mostly eat chinook salmon.Ocean conditions and poor river migration, with warm water and low flows, have hurt chinook salmon returns in the past several years. Even Columbia River fall chinook, a bright spot by comparison in the region, came back to the river in such low numbers last summer that a rare emergency fishing closure was enacted on the river from the mouth all the way to Pasco. Only 186,862 fall chinook made it back below Bonneville dam in 2018, 65 percent below[12] the 10-year average. Returns over Bonneville of jacks, or immature chinook, which can be a reliable predictor of this year's return, were down to 61 percent below the 10-year average.Columbia River chinook are important to the whales because they are among the biggest, fattiest fish of all. The whales also target chinook returning to rivers in Puget Sound, and in the summer, to the Fraser River. Those runs have been declining as well. The whales' behavior is changing as their food sources dwindle. They are arriving later and later in the San Juan Islands, because the Fraser River chinook runs they seek in those waters have so declined. The southern residents also are no longer often seen in large groups, in a pattern of feeding, then socializing, then resting before going on to a new spot. 'They do not have enough fish to feed them, they are spread out all over, we never seem them like it was 30, 40 years ago, when they would travel and find fish, then be playful, then rest, then travel again, that was the pattern,' Balcomb said. 'You don't see them resting any more, they have to work all the time, every day.'He said proposals put forward for the whales in the governor's $1.1 billion budget for orca recovery,[13] including a temporary ban on whale watching of the southern residents don't go far enough. 'We need bold action,' Balcomb said. 'Natural rivers and more chinook salmon.'

101,"This week, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives released the text of the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, which includes a historic $54 million for the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Puget Sound Geographic Program an increase of $19.75 million or 57 percent over Fiscal Year 2022. This investment, combined with a $17.8 million allocation from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, means Puget Sound will receive $71.8 million in federal funds next year to protect irreplaceable habitat. Today, the Senate passed the Omnibus by a vote of 68-29. The House is expected to vote on it this week. EPA Geographic Program Funding will support competitive grants and other projects through the Puget Sound Partnership, Tribes, and other stakeholders to clean up Puget Sound. Funded projects include salmon habitat restoration, toxicology, stormwater mitigation, and investments to improve core science needed to understand and respond to the top threats facing the region. This is a historic investment in Puget Sound recovery, said Sen. Cantwell The creation of the first-ever Puget Sound Recovery National Program office and Puget Sound Federal Task Force will mean that the Puget Sound, salmon, and orcas are poised to receive unprecedented support well into the future. This is critical to conducting the science needed to protect and restore our Sound for future generations. Puget Sound is central to our economy and environment, and it holds major significance to the many Washington state families, Tribes, and communities who count on it to be clean, healthy, and vibrant, said Sen. Murray. Protecting and restoring the ecosystems and habitats that make Washington state so special is a top priority for methats why Im glad I could help bring home more federal funding so our native wild specieslike our salmon can thrive, and Im focused on securing bold investments to make sure we have a healthy Sound for future generations. This $54 million federal investment to protect and restore Puget Sound is a big deal. Its a big deal because generations of friends and neighbors have built their lives on the Sound but if future generations are going to have the same opportunities, we need the federal government to make a meaningful commitment to protecting our regions most iconic body of water, said Rep. Derek Kilmer, Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. Together, with Senators Murray and Cantwell, Representative Strickland, the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, and many regional partners, we secured this funding to restore salmon and orca populations, ensure future generations can dig for clams, uphold tribal treaty rights, and so much more. ""Restoring Puget Sound will strengthen our economy and uphold our Pacific Northwest traditions, said Rep. Marilyn Strickland, Co-Chair of the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus. This important investment helps protect our Sound, rebuild its ecosystem, honor tribal treaty rights, and preserve tens of thousands of jobs for years to come. Puget Sound is an economic driver for the regions more than 4.7 million people and federally recognized Tribes. It is the largest estuary in the United States by volume. In addition to funding included in the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill, Senators Cantwell and Murray and Representatives Kilmer and Strickland included the Puget Save Our Sound Act (Puget SOS) in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2022. The bill establishes a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office within the Environmental Protection Agency and in coordination with NOAA and other federal agencies. The Puget SOS Act would also codify the Puget Sound Federal Leadership Task Force, which is made up of federal agencies that play a vital role in protecting Puget Sound. The Omnibus funds government programs through September 30, 2023. The text of the bill was released early Tuesday.

102,"U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell announced more than $59,645,607 in grant funding for 14 conservation projects across the State of Washington from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate-Ready Coasts initiative. The funding for these grants, which was secured through the Biden-Harris Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), were authored and championed by Sen. Cantwell. These grants will support 14 transformative conservation projects across the State of Washington from the Columbia River, to Hood Canal, the Nooksack, Nisqually, and Skagit Rivers, and all the way to Willapa Bay and the Olympic Coast. This investment will help make progress on salmon recovery, eel grass beds restoration, and removal of invasive European green crabs, and help communities and Tribes adapt to the impacts of climate change, said Sen. Cantwell. The awards announced by NOAA on April 21 include: Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience Projects funded through the BIL and IRA 1. $9,600,000 for the Hood Canal Salmon Enhancement Group -- Lower Big Quilcene River and Estuary Restoration Program Moon Valley Reach Construction Phase. These funds will benefit threatened Hood Canal Summer chum, as well as other key fish species including steelhead, coho, pink, fall Chinook, and fall chum. Channelization, dredging, and bank armoring have disconnected the river from its floodplain and confined it to an artificially straight and high-energy channel that frequently floods. Through this project, the river will be reconnected to its entire 140-acre floodplain, eliminating flood hazards within the community of Quilcene. The project will also create highly productive spawning and rearing habitat in a high priority location. 2. $7,500,000 for Lower Columbia Partnership Lower East Fork Lewis Floodplain Reclamation. These funds will help restore habitat along three miles of the lower East Fork Lewis River that have been severely impacted by legacy gravel mining and residential development. This river has been identified as a critical watershed for recovery for Lower Columbia River Chinook salmon, which is critical for endangered Southern resident orcas. The project will restore and reconnect a formerly-mined floodplain, remove levees, and restore habitat in and along streams. 3. $4,200,000 for Lummi Nation South Fork Nooksack River Restoration Project. These funds will advance three high-priority salmon habitat restoration projects along the South Fork Nooksack River. Salmon in the Nooksack River watershed are critically important to the livelihood, culture, and well-being of the Lummi Nation, but degraded habitat has diminished the abundance of several salmon stocks substantially from historical levels. This work will support Endangered Species Act-listed Puget Sound Chinook and steelhead, and benefit endangered Southern resident orcas. The effort will include implementation of two projects and the design of a third. The work will increase flood resilience, improve water quality, and enhance tribal fisheries. 4. $11,600,000 for Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife North Whidbey Chinook and Ecosystem Recovery: Skagit River. These funds will be used to support large-scale restoration in the North Whidbey basin of the Skagit River estuary in Puget Sound, building on more than two decades of NOAA-supported restoration work in the watershed. The scale of restoration of estuary marshes and floodplains will result in better habitat for salmon. The work is expected to reduce flooding on county roadways and tribal lands. Two of the sites are located on Swinomish Indian Tribal Community land with coordination and support of the Swinomish and Sauk-Suiattle Tribes. 5. $12,100,000 for Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Transformational Chinook Recovery in South Whidbey Basin. These funds will be used to restore 1,200 acres within the South Whidbey Basin of Puget Sound. They will implement seven restoration projects and continue work to develop five future projects. The Whidbey Basin contains Puget Sounds three biggest salmon producing rivers and nearly 70 percent of its remaining tidal wetlands, which salmon and steelhead rely on for spawning and rearing habitat. While significant as a stand-alone effort, when leveraging the North Whidbey Basin work, the efforts are of a combined scale that will significantly contribute better habitat for threatened Puget Sound Chinook salmon and steelhead. Salmon restoration efforts will also benefit Southern resident orcas. 6. $5,200,000 for Nooksack Indian Tribe Lower South Fork Nooksack Chinook Recovery. These funds will address priority habitat limiting factors for salmon and steelhead in the South Fork Nooksack River. Declining populations of Chinook salmon and other species have had significant impacts on the Nooksack Tribes cultural, subsistence, and commercial fisheries. By increasing habitat complexity and increasing the number of pools in the region to address summer flows, this work will support multiple life stages of salmon and enhance their resilience to climate change. The effort will encompass construction of two projects and the design of a third. The work will help reduce flood risk to the nearby town of Acme through increased water storage and construction of a berm. 7. $817,000 for Edmonds College Restoration for All (R4A). In partnership with the Latino Educational Training Institute and Snohomish Conservation District, Edmonds College will create a bilingual restoration workforce development program to educate and train members of the Latino community. The program will include paid internship opportunities, providing participants with hands-on experience restoring salmon habitat in the Stillaguamish and Snohomish watersheds.

103," U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced $36 million in grant funds to state, local, Tribal and federal partners to support the continued conservation and restoration of Puget Sound.  The funding was awarded from the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) National Estuary Program and the Puget Sound Geographic Funds to support development and implementation of the Puget Sound Action Agenda.  With this $36 million investment in Puget Sound, government agencies and Tribes will work to stop stormwater pollution, improve water quality, restore habitat and accelerate the recovery of our salmon and orca populations. This investment will help provide a healthier Puget Sound for our people, our economy and our wildlife, said Senator Cantwell.  Puget Sound is vital to so many Tribes and communities throughout Washington state. Its central to our economy, our environment, and our way of life. Salmon, shellfish, orcas, and the families who have grown up on the waters edge count on it to be healthy and vibrant, said Senator Murray. We owe it to future generations to preserve this precious ecosystem and its native wildlife and this funding I worked to pass will help Washington state do just that. Im glad we are able to make these critical investments, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to protect the Sound and ensure it is clean, safe, and thriving for years to come.  The total $36 million will be allocated to the following programs:  $8.5 million to the Puget Sound Partnership. The Puget Sound Partnership will also receive $900,000 in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding.  $7.0 million to 19 federally recognized Tribes, the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, Skagit River System Cooperative and Point no Point Treaty Council  $7.2 million to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and Washington Department of Natural Resources for habitat recovery  $5.7 million to the Department of Ecology for stormwater work, including transportation runoff  $4.5 million to Washington Department of Health for shellfish restoration and pathogen reduction  $3.3 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for federal science through Interagency Agreements with NOAA, USGS, USFS and DOE  According to EPA, Congress has appropriated over $420 million in Clean Water Act National Estuary Program and Geographic Program funds for Puget Sound since 2006. State, local, Tribal and federal partners have used these funds to leverage nearly $2.1 billion of additional funds largely from the state of Washington.   These grants have helped restore more than 50,000 acres of habitat, increased protection of over 150,000 acres of harvestable shellfish beds, and funded cutting edge research on chemicals in automobiles and roadway runoff.  Throughout their time in the Senate, Sens. Cantwell and Murray have been staunch advocates of conservation and restoration investments for Puget Sound, and protecting and strengthening critical salmon populations. In 2021, Cantwell and Murray secured historic investments for salmon recovery, including $89 million for the Puget Sound Geographic Program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That bill also included a number of provisions that would benefit salmon and ecosystem restoration, including $172 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF), a grant program that provides funding to states and Tribes to protect, conserve, and restore endangered and threatened salmon populations. In December 2021, Cantwell and Murray also announced $34 million for Puget Sound recovery efforts from the EPA National Estuary Fund.

We owe it to future generations to preserve this precious ecosystem and its native wildlife and this funding I worked to pass will help Washington state do just that. Im glad we are able to make these critical investments, and I am going to continue doing everything I can to protect the Sound and ensure it is clean, safe, and thriving for years to come.  With this $36 million investment in Puget Sound, government agencies and Tribes will work to stop stormwater pollution, improve water quality, restore habitat and accelerate the recovery of our salmon and orca populations. This investment will help provide a healthier Puget Sound for our people, our economy and our wildlife, said Senator Cantwell.

105,"SEATTLE — The Coast Guard has kicked off Operation Be Whale Wise to encourage the public to practice safe whale-watching this summer in the Pacific Northwest. Operation Be Whale Wise, which began Friday, is an effort to educate the public through outreach and enforcement activities, as well as increase the public's stewardship of orcas through engagement of citizen science, the Coast Guard said in a press release. The Coast Guard is working closely with several partner agencies focused on educating the public and raising awareness within the boating community, including enforcing buffer zones and other vessel-related regulations in place to protect the Southern Resident orca population of the Puget Sound. The Puget Sound and Salish Sea is home to numerous species of marine mammals. The most recognized of these is the Southern Resident orcas. This species is a distinct population of orcas that are genetically unique from their transient counterparts. They have evolved to feed on fish instead of mammals. Southern Resident orcas are critically endangered, with only 74 members remaining as of May 31. Federal regulations prohibit vessels from approaching orcas within 200 yards or parking in their path. In 2019, the state enacted regulations requiring vessels to remain at least 300 yards away from either side or 400 yards in front of or behind orcas. Additionally, state regulations require that vessels within a half mile of orcas must reduce speed to less than 7 knots. As of today, 13 Southern Residents have been deemed in vulnerable conditions, the Coast Guard said, adding that four may be pregnant. The state has adopted an emergency rule to prevent commercial whale watching vessels from approaching individuals or groups within 0.5 nautical miles. The Coast Guard issued these guidelines: ߦ Keep your distance: Do not approach or get too close to marine life and stay 0.5 nautical miles away. Look in all directions before planning your approach to view wildlife. Slow down and reduce your speed to less than 7 knots when within a half mile of the nearest marine mammal to reduce your engine's noise and vessel's wake. ߦ Pay Attention: Be vigilant for marine mammal presence. Whales may change directions or surface unpredictably. Move away slowly and cautiously at the first sign of a disturbance or agitation. ߦ Be mindful of your vessel: Place engine in neutral or shutdown and allow the animals to pass if your vessel is not in compliance with regulations. If it's safe to do so, also turn off your fish finder and echo sounders. ߦ Be courteous: Stay on the offshore side of whales when they are traveling close to shore. Always avoid going through groups of porpoises or dolphins. Hold course and reduce speed gradually to discourage bow or stern-riding. ߦ Report whale sightings: The WhaleReport App helps mariners and members of the public practice citizen science by providing a user-friendly tool directly on their tablet or smart phone that displays whale safety zones. The app also allows the user to report any live, dead, or distressed whale sightings to the appropriate response agency. Be Whale Wise is a coordinated effort between the U.S. and Canada with multiple commercial, nonprofit and environmental non-governmental organizations participating.
